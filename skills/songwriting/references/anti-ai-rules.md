# Anti-AI Rules

Quality gates to make lyrics sound human, not generated.

---

## The Core Test

For every line, ask:

> "Would someone actually say this?"

If the answer is no, or "maybe in a poem," rewrite it.

## Banned Phrase Categories

**Filler phrases:**

- deep inside
- here and now
- forever and always

**Greeting card endings:**
- love conquers all

- as long as we have each other

### Structural Cliches

**Opening patterns (banned):**
- Time of day ("It was 3 a.m...")
- Weather + time ("The rain fell that Tuesday...")
- "I remember when..."
- "Let me tell you about..."

**Ending patterns (avoid):**
- Rhetorical question as last line
- Repeating title 4+ times
- "...and I always will"
- "...till the end of time"

## The "Said vs Written" Test

**Written (bad):**
> "In the depths of my despair, I found a glimmer of hope"

**Said (good):**
> "I was losing it, then something clicked"

**Written (bad):**
> "Your love is a beacon in my darkest night"

**Said (good):**
> "You're the only thing that makes sense right now"

**Written (bad):**
> "The weight of the world rests upon my weary shoulders"

**Said (good):**
> "I'm so tired of carrying this"

---

## Rhyme Quality Rules

### Perfect Rhymes: Use Sparingly

Perfect rhymes can sound forced and predictable.

**Too perfect (cheesy):**
- love/above/dove
- heart/apart/start
- fire/desire/higher
- night/right/light
- pain/rain/again

**Better: Near rhymes and slant rhymes:**
- love/enough/stuff
- heart/apart/hard
- fire/tired/liar
- night/life/right
- pain/strange/change

### Rhyme Scheme Variation

Don't rhyme every line. Mix:
- ABAB (standard)
- ABCB (looser)
- AABB (punchy)
- ABAC (unexpected)
- No rhyme for 2-3 lines, then land one

---

## Line Variety Requirements

### Length Variation

**Bad (all same length):**
```
I've been thinking about you lately
I've been wondering where you are
I've been hoping that you're happy
I've been wishing on a star
```

**Good (varied lengths):**
```
Been thinking about you
More than I should, probably
It's embarrassing honestly
But I can't stop
```

### Conversational Texture

Include 2-3 "throwaway" lines per song. Low-stakes moments that make the big lines hit harder.

**Throwaway examples:**
- "I don't know"
- "Whatever"
- "It is what it is"
- "Honestly?"
- "I mean"
- "You know?"
- "Not gonna lie"

**Placed strategically:**
```
I still love you
(I don't know why I'm saying this)
But I do
```

## Forced Creativity Rules

### The Rejection Rule
- Generate 5 hook ideas, reject first 3
- Use idea 4 or 5

### The Deletion Rule
- Generate 35 words for word bank
- Delete 5 most obvious words
- What's left is your palette

### The Specificity Rule
- If you wrote "car" - what kind of car?
- If you wrote "drink" - what drink specifically?
- If you wrote "place" - what place exactly?

### The Inversion Test
- Take your hook
- Say the opposite
- Is the opposite more interesting?
- If yes, use the opposite

1. Remove adjectives
2. Make it shorter
3. Add hesitation ("I mean", "honestly")
4. Use contractions
5. Fragment the sentence

### Hook is too on-the-nose
1. Say it sideways
2. Use understatement
3. Focus on a small detail
4. Use contradiction

### Verse is too predictable
1. Start second verse in unexpected place
2. Skip forward in time
3. Switch POV briefly
4. Add a throwaway line
