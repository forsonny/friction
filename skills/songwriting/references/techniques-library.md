## Hook Techniques

### 1. Micro-Hook (2-3 syllables)
Short, punchy, impossible to forget.

| Song | Hook | Syllables | Why It Works |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|
| Fast Car | "Fast car" | 2 | Concrete object becomes metaphor |
| Skinny Love | "Skinny love" | 3 | Invented adjective for emotion |
| Hallelujah | "Hallelujah" | 4 | Sacred word made secular |

**When to use:** When the concept is singular and strong. Let the verses do the explaining.

### 2. Contradiction Hook
Gentle word + brutal meaning (or vice versa).

| Song | Hook | The Contradiction |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Whiskey Lullaby | "Put him to sleep with a whiskey lullaby" | "Lullaby" is nurturing, whiskey is destroying |
| The Funeral | "Ready for the funeral" | Preparedness for loss, not grief itself |

**When to use:** Tragedy, complex emotions, when you want to say something brutal gently.

### 3. Universal Phrase Hook
Exact words people actually say in emotional moments.

| Song | Hook | Real-World Usage |
|------|------|------------------|
| Rolling in the Deep | "We could have had it all" | What everyone says after a breakup |
| Royals | "We'll never be royals" | Resigned acceptance of class reality |
| Don't Stop Believin' | "Don't stop believin'" | Encouragement phrase |

**When to use:** When you want immediate emotional recognition. The listener has said this phrase.

### 4. Rejection Hook
Hooks that deny instead of affirm.

| Song | Hook | What It Rejects |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Royals | "We'll never be royals" | Aspiration culture |
| Smells Like Teen Spirit | "Here we are now, entertain us" | Consumer demand as boredom |

**When to use:** Critique, subversion, anti-anthems.

### 5. Delayed Hook
Withhold the hook for maximum impact.

| Song | Delay | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| Don't Stop Believin' | Chorus at 3:20 | Explosive payoff after long build |
| Fast Car | Chorus after two verses | "Fast car" earns its weight |

**When to use:** Story-driven songs, when context changes hook meaning.

## Opening Techniques (Advanced)

Beyond the 8 basics, these techniques add sophistication:

### Paradox Opening
Two contradicting truths in the first line.

**Example:** The Funeral
> "I'm coming up only to hold you under"

- "Coming up" = rescue
- "Hold you under" = drowning
- Creates immediate engagement through contradiction

### Character Sketch Opening
Introduce an archetype immediately.

**Example:** Don't Stop Believin'
> "Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world"

- "Just" = underestimation that will be proven wrong
- Universal archetype everyone recognizes

### Simile-First Opening
Lead with an unexpected comparison.

**Example:** Whiskey Lullaby
> "She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette"

- Visceral image
- "Put out" = extinguished (casual cruelty)
- Cigarette = easily discarded

### Musical Meta Opening
Song about the act of singing or music itself.

**Example:** Hallelujah
> "I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord"

- Music about music
- Mystery (secret chord) + authority (David, Lord)

## Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Invented Vocabulary
Create new phrases for emotions that don't have names.

| Song | Invention | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Skinny Love | "skinny love" | Malnourished, fragile relationship |

**How to use:** Apply an unexpected adjective to an abstract noun. Test: Does it feel right even though it's "wrong"?

### 2. Deliberate Incoherence
Meaning through anti-meaning.

| Song | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Smells Like Teen Spirit | "A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido" | Random list conveys chaos of adolescence |

**When to use:** Generational frustration, inability to articulate feelings, overwhelming confusion.

### 3. Biblical/Literary Elevation
Anchor personal experience in myth.

| Song | Reference | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Hallelujah | David/Bathsheba, Samson/Delilah | Ancient stories mirror modern heartbreak |
| Tangled Up in Blue | "Poems from 13th century Italian" | Elevates barroom story to literature |

**When to use:** When personal story needs weight. Don't explain the reference.

### 4. Euphemism as Devastation
Say something brutal gently.

| Song | Euphemism | Brutal Reality |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Whiskey Lullaby | "Put him to sleep with a whiskey lullaby" | Drank himself to death |

**When to use:** Tragedy. The gentleness of the word increases the violence of the meaning.

### 5. Communal Witness
"We" watched and did nothing.

| Song | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Whiskey Lullaby | "We watched him drink his pain away" | Community complicity in tragedy |

**When to use:** Stories where society failed someone. Third-person plural as helpless bystander.

### 6. Time Collapse
Past and present tense mix within verses.

| Song | Technique | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Tangled Up in Blue | Tense shifts mid-verse | How memory actually works |

**When to use:** Memory songs, nostalgia, unreliable narrator.

### 7. Shifting Pronouns
"I," "he," "she" perspectives change without warning.

| Song | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Tangled Up in Blue | Narrator becomes observer becomes character | Identity is fluid, memory is unreliable |

**When to use:** Complex relationships, self-reflection, when distance from the story varies.

### 8. Parallel Structure
Same format, two tragedies (or characters).

| Song | Structure | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Whiskey Lullaby | His decline, her decline - identical structure | Tragic inevitability through symmetry |
| Don't Stop Believin' | "Small town girl" / "City boy" | Two lonely people converging |

**When to use:** Dual narratives, relationship balance, before/after stories.

### 9. Self-Aware Meta Moments
Song acknowledges its own performance.

| Song | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Don't Stop Believin' | "A singer in a smoky room, smell of wine and cheap perfume" | We're in the song and watching it |

**When to use:** Sparingly. Creates connection between performance and story.

### 10. Genre Critique Through Genre
Use genre conventions to critique them.

| Song | Technique | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Royals | Name-drops Cristal, Maybach while rejecting them | Knows the tropes, dismantles them |

**When to use:** Subversion, commentary, anti-establishment takes.

### 11. Fragmented Syntax
Incomplete sentences as emotional expression.

| Song | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Skinny Love | "Pour a little salt, we were never here" | Fragmentation mirrors emotional state |

**When to use:** Overwhelm, inability to complete thoughts, raw emotion.

### 12. Absent Title
Title word/phrase creates atmosphere, not subject.

| Song | Title Use | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| The Funeral | "Funeral" appears only in hook | The feeling is funeral, not the event |

**When to use:** When the title is tone rather than topic.

## "Said Not Written" Markers

### Informal Grammar
Use spoken patterns, not written correctness.

| Written (Bad) | Said (Good) | Song Reference |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| "I have seen" | "I seen" | Tangled Up in Blue |
| "going" | "goin'" | Don't Stop Believin', Fast Car |
| "is not" | "ain't" | Royals, Fast Car |

### Hesitation Markers
Qualifiers that sound like actual speech.

**Good examples from songs:**
- "Had a feeling" instead of "knew"
- "Probably"
- "Honestly"
- "I mean"
- "I don't know"

### Trailing Off
Let thoughts end incomplete.

| Complete (Written) | Trailing (Said) |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| "It continues forever" | "It goes on and on and on" |
| "I don't know what to do" | "I don't know" |

### Direct Questions
Questions that could be asked in real conversation.

**Examples:**
- "Who will love you?" (Skinny Love)
- "Is it fast enough so we can fly away?" (Fast Car)
- "But you don't really care for music, do you?" (Hallelujah)

## Cliche Subversion Strategies

When your first instinct is a cliche, use these:

### Show Failure, Not Success
| Expected | Subversion | Song |
|----------|------------|------|
| Escape to somewhere better | Escape fails | Fast Car |
| Love conquers poverty | Love eroded by poverty | Fast Car |

### State, Don't Moralize
| Expected | Subversion | Song |
|----------|------------|------|
| "Money can't buy happiness" | Just states preference, no lesson | Royals |
| "We're different and proud" | "We'll never be royals" - factual, not proud | Royals |

### Anger Over Sadness
| Expected | Subversion | Song |
|----------|------------|------|
| "You broke my heart" | Fire/burn imagery, rage | Rolling in the Deep |
| "Please come back" | Anger, threat | Rolling in the Deep |

### Leave Things Undefined
| Expected | Subversion | Song |
|----------|------------|------|
| Name the goal/dream | "Believin'" in what? Undefined | Don't Stop Believin' |
| Explain the metaphor | "Skinny love" - never defined | Skinny Love |

### Damaged Is Beautiful
| Expected | Subversion | Song |
|----------|------------|------|
| "Praise the Lord" | "Cold and broken hallelujah" | Hallelujah |
| Perfect healing | Imperfect praise is still praise | Hallelujah |

## Integration with Phases

### Phase 3 (Word Bank)
Reference Lyrical Techniques 1-3 when building palette:
- Can you invent a phrase?
- Is there a literary reference that fits?
- Can incoherence serve the emotion?

### Phase 4 (Hook Forging)
Test hooks against the 5 Hook Techniques:
- Is it micro enough?
- Does it contain contradiction?
- Is it a universal phrase?
- Does it reject something?
- Should it be delayed?

### Phase 5 (Structure)
Consider narrative techniques when choosing structure:
- Parallel structure needs space (C or F)
- Time collapse works in G (Minimal) with multiple verses
- Delayed hook = C (Slow Burn)

### Phase 6 (Anti-AI Sweep)
Check for "Said Not Written" markers:
- Informal grammar present?
- Hesitation markers included?
- Any trailing-off moments?
- Direct questions that sound real?
