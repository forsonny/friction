## Replacement Strategies

When a cliche is detected:

1. **Find the specific version**
   - "pickup truck" -> "your brother's Tacoma"
   - "cold beer" -> "half-empty Modelo"
   - "small town" -> "[actual town name] population 800"

2. **Use the unexpected object**
   - "wedding ring" -> "expired grocery store receipt from that trip"
   - "photograph" -> "parking ticket from the night we met"

3. **Subvert the expectation**
   - "Friday night" -> "Tuesday afternoon"
   - "moonlight" -> "parking lot lights"
   - "dance floor" -> "kitchen linoleum"

4. **Go smaller and more specific**
   - "tears" -> "that thing you do with your jaw when you're about to cry"
   - "broken heart" -> "can't eat, can't sleep, keep checking my phone"
