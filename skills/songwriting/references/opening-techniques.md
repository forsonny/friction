# 8 Opening Techniques

Never start with time of day ("It was 11 p.m. on a Tuesday..."). Use these instead.

---

## 1. Dialogue Fragment

Start mid-conversation. Feels immediate and real.

**Examples:**
- "You said 'don't look back' like it was easy"
- "She goes 'I'm fine' but she's already crying"
- "'We should talk' - three words I never wanted"
- "He said 'forever' like he meant it"

**Works for:** Relationship songs, conflict, breakups

---

## 2. Sensory Snapshot

Drop into a specific sensory moment. Grounding and cinematic.

**Examples:**
- "Coffee's gone cold on the counter"
- "Rain on the windshield, wipers on slow"
- "Smell of her perfume still on my jacket"
- "Static on the radio between stations"

**Works for:** Nostalgia, memory, atmosphere

---

## 3. Action in Progress

Start in the middle of something happening. Creates momentum.

**Examples:**
- "Packing boxes in the kitchen"
- "Driving 85 with the windows down"
- "Scrolling through old photos on my phone"
- "Walking out before I change my mind"

**Works for:** Movement songs, decisions, transitions

---

## 4. Rhetorical Question

Draw the listener in with a question they can't ignore.

**Examples:**
- "How do you unlove someone?"
- "What do you say when sorry isn't enough?"
- "Is this what moving on feels like?"
- "Why do we always want what we can't have?"

**Works for:** Universal themes, vulnerability, introspection

**Caution:** Easy to make cliche. Keep it specific, not generic.

---

## 5. Confession/Admission

Immediate vulnerability. Draws listener into intimacy.

**Examples:**
- "I still check if you're online"
- "I lied when I said I was over you"
- "I keep your voicemail saved"
- "Truth is, I never stopped"

**Works for:** Honesty songs, heartbreak, self-awareness

---

## 6. Contradiction

Two things that shouldn't go together. Creates tension immediately.

**Examples:**
- "I love you and I need to leave"
- "Best thing that happened, worst thing I did"
- "Home doesn't feel like home anymore"
- "I'm fine, I'm a mess, I'm both at once"

**Works for:** Complex emotions, internal conflict, nuance

---

## 7. Place-Grounding

Establish a specific location. Makes everything more real.

**Examples:**
- "Back seat of your brother's car"
- "Kitchen table, 2 in the morning"
- "Same bar stool, same cheap beer"
- "Standing on your porch in the rain"

**Works for:** Story songs, nostalgia, specificity

**Caution:** Location only, not time. "Same bar stool" good. "Same bar stool at midnight" is time-of-day cheating.

---

## 8. Object Focus

Start with a specific thing. Concrete and tangible.

**Examples:**
- "Your hoodie's still hanging on my door"
- "There's a ring in my pocket I never gave"
- "Half-empty bottle of the wine we shared"
- "Expired library card with your name on it"

**Works for:** Tangible loss, memory, symbolism

## Red Flags - Openings to AVOID

**Time-of-day openings:**
- "It was midnight when..."
- "3 a.m., couldn't sleep..."
- "That Sunday morning..."
- "Late one Friday night..."

**Weather + time combinations:**
- "It was raining that Tuesday night..."
- "The summer sun was setting..."

**Cliche narrative setups:**
- "I remember when..."
- "Once upon a time..."
- "Let me tell you about..."
- "This is the story of..."

If you catch yourself using any of these, apply one of the 8 techniques instead.
