## Structure Selection Guide

| If the song needs... | Use Structure |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Standard arc, safe choice | A (but question if you're defaulting) |
| Immediate hook impact | B |
| Story before payoff | C |
| Mid-song twist | D |
| Pure energy, no breaks | E |
| Emotional fade-out | F |
| Intimacy and simplicity | G |

**Red flag:** If you're picking A without a reason, you're probably defaulting. Consider C or G instead.
