## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** E (Spiral)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Fantasy life |
| Chorus | 4 | The admission |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Fantasy continues |
| Chorus | 4 | Darker now |
| Bridge | 6 | Reality intrudes |
| Outro | 8 | Accepting the pretend |

**Why this structure works:**
Fantasy and reality weave together. By the end, "pretend" is both escape and acceptance.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 6 (Thematic Declaration)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw, I'm in the prime of my life"

**Why it works:**
Contradiction in one breath. "Rough" and "raw" against "prime of my life" - youth as damage.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "This is our decision, to live fast and die young"

**Syllable count:** 12

**Conversational test:** Pass - Pact between friends

**Why it works:**
- "Our decision" - collective choice
- "Live fast die young" - cliche made sincere through delivery
- Awareness that it's a role being played

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Ironic rockstar fantasy
**Example:**
> Lists rockstar cliches while acknowledging their emptiness

**Why it works:** Wants and critiques simultaneously

### 2. Death as punchline
**Example:**
> "Choke on our vomit" - unglamorous end

**Why it works:** Punctures the fantasy from within

### 3. Childhood friend frame
**Example:**
> The "we" is specific - two friends imagining

**Why it works:** Grounds fantasy in real relationship

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw"
   - Sounds said because: Self-assessment, casual

2. > "Let's make some music, make some money, find some models for wives"
   - Sounds said because: Juvenile planning

3. > "We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end"
   - Sounds said because: Dark humor between friends

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Live fast die young" glamorized | Shows the ugly end (vomit) |
| "Fame is empty" preachy | Wants fame while knowing it's empty |
| "Youth is wasted" | Youth is knowing it's pretend |

## Key Takeaways

1. You can want something and critique it simultaneously
2. Self-awareness doesn't have to mean cynicism
3. The best fantasies acknowledge they're fantasies
