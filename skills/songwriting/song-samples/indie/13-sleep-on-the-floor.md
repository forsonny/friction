## Lyrical Analysis

### Theme
The song captures the romantic impulsiveness of youth - the fantasy of abandoning everything for love and adventure. It's specifically American in its road-trip mythology, channeling Kerouac and Springsteen.

### Opening Approach
The song opens with a dismissal of the past - telling someone to forget everything that came before. This establishes the clean-slate mentality of escape narratives.

### Craft Techniques
- **Concrete details**: Specific objects (toothbrush, city names) ground abstract emotions
- **Imperative voice**: Commands create urgency ("pack," "forget," "come")
- **Geographic specificity**: Place names add authenticity
- **Romantic pragmatism**: The title's "sleep on the floor" mixes romance with reality

### Story Arc
The lyrics progress from invitation to action to reflection:
1. Initial invitation to escape
2. Acknowledgment of what's left behind
3. Justification through philosophy
4. Declaration of intent
