## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 8 (Memory Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Sleeping is giving in, no matter what the time is"

**Why it works:**
Childhood fear stated as adult philosophy. Immediately establishes the paranoid logic of youth.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Lies, lies"

**Syllable count:** 2

**Conversational test:** Pass - Accusation a child would shout

**Why it works:**
- Shortest possible hook
- Accusatory, raw
- Can be whispered or screamed

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Childhood logic as wisdom
**Example:**
> "Sleeping is giving in" - child's fear reframed

**Why it works:** Takes irrational fear seriously

### 2. Parental betrayal
**Example:**
> "Every time you close your eyes"

**Why it works:** Sleep as vulnerability, taught by those who should protect

### 3. Repetition as exorcism
**Example:**
> "Lies" repeated until it loses meaning, then regains it

**Why it works:** Word becomes primal scream

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Sleeping is giving in"
   - Sounds said because: Child's stubborn logic

2. > "No matter what the time is"
   - Sounds said because: The defensive addition

3. > "Every time you close your eyes"
   - Sounds said because: Warning tone

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Growing up is hard" | Made childhood fear the subject |
| "Parents don't understand" | Parents as source of existential terror |
| "Be yourself" | "Rebellion" without instruction |
