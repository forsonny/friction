## Lyrical Analysis

### Theme
The song uses cosmic and natural imagery to describe attraction and desire. It's essentially a love/lust song filtered through a psychedelic lens, making the ordinary feel extraordinary.

### Imagery Approach
Rather than direct romantic language, the lyrics invoke:
- Celestial bodies (moon, stars)
- Electrical/energy metaphors
- Natural elements
- Physical sensation translated to cosmic scale

### Craft Techniques
- **Synesthesia**: Describing feelings as "electric" merges sensation types
- **Cosmic scale**: Personal desire expanded to universal significance
- **Simplicity in complexity**: Simple words, surreal combinations
- **Repetition as mantra**: Key phrases become hypnotic

---

## Melodic Analysis

### Vocal Approach
- Relaxed, almost conversational delivery
- Limited range keeps it accessible
- Falsetto appears strategically for emphasis
- Melodic phrases fit neatly within groove pockets

### Hook Construction
The "she's got that electric feel" hook works because:
- Syncopation against the beat
- Ascending phrase builds energy
- Simple enough to sing along immediately
- "Electric" stretched to emphasize concept

## Harmonic Analysis

### Chord Progression
Verse: | Dm | Am | Dm | Am |

### Harmonic Techniques
- **Minor mode dance**: Dm creates mysterious vibe while remaining danceable

- **Pedal bass**: Steady low end anchors floating harmonies
- **Modal inflections**: Subtle Dorian touches

## Production Notes

### Arrangement Elements
- **Synth arpeggio**: The iconic bubbling pattern drives everything
- **Bass**: Funky, syncopated line with octave jumps
- **Drums**: Tight, disco-influenced pattern
- **Guitar**: Sparse funk stabs
- **Keys**: Layered pads and arpeggios
- **Vocals**: Multi-tracked, treated with effects

### The Arpeggio
The synth arpeggio is the song's identity:
- 16th note pattern
- Follows chord changes
- Filtered for movement
- Slightly detuned for warmth

### Sonic Characteristics
- Warm, analog synth tones
- Compression on drums for punch
- Wide stereo spread
- Vintage-feeling despite modern production
