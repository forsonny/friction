## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Fragmented confession |
| Chorus | 4 | The breaking point |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Deeper desperation |
| Chorus | 4 | Intensified plea |
| Bridge | 4 | Raw confrontation |
| Chorus | 4 | Final release |

**Why this structure works:**
Builds emotional pressure through repetition. Each chorus hits harder as context accumulates. The falsetto delivery makes raw words feel urgent.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Mid-Action)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Come on skinny love, just last the year"

**Why it works:**
Drops us into an ongoing struggle. "Just last" implies survival mode - we understand this relationship is barely holding on.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Skinny love"

**Syllable count:** 3

**Conversational test:** Pass - A nickname someone might whisper

**Why it works:**
- "Skinny" applied to love is unexpected
- Implies malnourished, fragile, barely surviving
- Sounds like a private term between two people

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Invented vocabulary
**Example:**
> "Skinny love" - a phrase that didn't exist before this song

**Why it works:** Creates ownership. Now it means this specific feeling.

### 2. Fragmented syntax
**Example:**
> "Pour a little salt, we were never here"

**Why it works:** Incomplete thoughts mirror emotional fragmentation

### 3. Direct address switching
**Example:**
> Alternates between "my" and addressing the love directly

**Why it works:** Shows internal vs. external struggle

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Come on skinny love"
   - Sounds said because: "Come on" is pure spoken exasperation

2. > "Who will love you?"
   - Sounds said because: Direct question, almost cruel

3. > "I told you to be patient"
   - Sounds said because: Sounds like actual argument dialogue

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Our love is dying" | "Skinny love" - visual, original |
| "I can't take it anymore" | "Just last the year" - specific timeline |
| "You broke my heart" | Fragmented images, never states directly |
