# The Funeral

**Artist:** Band of Horses
**Album:** Everything All the Time (2006)
**Genre:** Indie Rock

## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Atmospheric scene-setting |
| Chorus | 4 | The revelation |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Deepening contemplation |
| Chorus | 4 | Expanded meaning |
| Bridge | 4 | Shift in perspective |
| Outro Chorus | 8 | Release through repetition |

**Why this structure works:**
Long instrumental passages give weight to sparse lyrics. The title word never appears in lyrics - the feeling is funeral, not the event.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Observation)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I'm coming up only to hold you under"

**Why it works:**
Paradox immediately. "Coming up" suggests rescue, "hold you under" is drowning. Love as destruction.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral"

**Syllable count:** 15

**Conversational test:** Pass - Morbid but sounds like honest confession

**Why it works:**
- "Every occasion" - constant vigilance
- Preparation for loss, not the loss itself
- Funeral is metaphor for endings

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Paradox as opener
**Example:**
> "Coming up only to hold you under"

**Why it works:** Contradiction creates immediate engagement

### 2. Absent title
**Example:**
> "Funeral" appears only in hook, not explored

**Why it works:** Title becomes atmosphere, not subject

### 3. Reverb as lyric
**Example:**
> The production carries emotional weight lyrics don't state

**Why it works:** Sound and word work together

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I'm coming up only to hold you under"
   - Sounds said because: Confession structure, admitting ugly truth

2. > "At every occasion"
   - Sounds said because: The formality is defensive, guarded

3. > "I'm coming up only to show you wrong"
   - Sounds said because: Spite in a relationship feels real

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'll always be there" | "Ready for the funeral" - dark twist |
| "Our love is complicated" | Shows through paradox, never states |
| "Death imagery = sad" | Funeral as preparation, not grief |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Paradox in the first line creates immediate engagement
2. A title can be a feeling rather than subject matter
3. Let production carry what lyrics don't need to say
