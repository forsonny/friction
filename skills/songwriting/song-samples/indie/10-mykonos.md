## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Departure scene |
| Chorus | 6 | Brother address |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Memory of place |
| Chorus | 6 | Plea intensifies |
| Bridge | 8 | Letting go |
| Outro | 12 | Harmonized release |

Builds from intimate verse to communal chorus. The harmonies in outro make "you" become "we."

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 8 (Memory Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us"

**Why it works:**
Physical memory - we hear and feel the slam. "On us" includes listener immediately.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Brother, you don't need to turn me away"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Plea to actual brother

**Why it works:**
- "Brother" - specific relationship
- "Don't need to" - not "don't" but "don't need to"
- Vulnerability without begging

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Place as character
**Example:**
> "Mykonos" - never described, just named

**Why it works:** Mystery of the specific unknown

### 2. Sensory memory
**Example:**
> "Cloud of dust on us" - tactile

**Why it works:** Physical memory is more vivid than emotional statement

### 3. Brother as address
**Example:**
> Could be literal or spiritual brother

**Why it works:** Specific and universal simultaneously

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Brother, you don't need to turn me away"
   - Sounds said because: Direct plea, informal

2. > "The door slammed loud"
   - Sounds said because: Describing a moment that just happened

3. > "You go wherever you go today"
   - Sounds said because: Reluctant blessing

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Don't leave me" | "You don't need to turn me away" - different angle |
| "Remember the good times" | Specific sensory image (dust) |
| "We'll meet again" | "You go wherever you go" - acceptance |

## Key Takeaways

1. A place name can carry meaning without description
