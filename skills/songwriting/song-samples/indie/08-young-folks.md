## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** B (Call and Response)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Intro | 4 | Whistled hook |
| Verse 1 (Male) | 6 | His perspective |
| Verse 1 (Female) | 6 | Her response |
| Chorus | 4 | Together |
| Verse 2 | 12 | Trading lines |
| Chorus | 4 | Unity |
| Outro | 8 | Whistle returns |

**Why this structure works:**
Duet structure mirrors flirtation. Two voices becoming one chorus is the relationship arc.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 1 (Dialogue Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "If I told you things I did before, told you how I used to be"

**Why it works:**
Conditional confession. "If I told you" - hasn't told yet. Creates intrigue.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> The whistle melody (non-verbal)

**Syllable count:** 0 (instrumental)

**Conversational test:** Pass - Something you'd actually whistle

**Why it works:**
- Impossible not to whistle along
- Carries song without words
- Universal - needs no translation

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Conditional framing
**Example:**
> "If I told you" - the telling hasn't happened

**Why it works:** Creates anticipation, not revelation

### 2. Duet as conversation
**Example:**
> Lines respond to each other directly

**Why it works:** Feels like eavesdropping on flirtation

### 3. Vagueness as intimacy
**Example:**
> "Things I did before" - never specified

**Why it works:** Mystery is sexier than confession

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "If I told you things I did before"
   - Sounds said because: How you'd start a confession

2. > "Would you go along with someone like me?"
   - Sounds said because: Vulnerable question

3. > "We don't care about the young folks"
   - Sounds said because: Dismissive, insider feeling

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Let me tell you about myself" | "If I told you" - conditional |
| "We're different from everyone" | "Don't care about young folks" - exclusionary |
| "Love at first sight" | Process of revealing, not instant connection |

## Key Takeaways

1. A whistle can be the best hook in a song
2. Duets can show relationship dynamics without stating them
3. What you don't reveal is as important as what you do
