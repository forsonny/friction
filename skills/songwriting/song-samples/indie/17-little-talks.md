## Lyrical Analysis

### Theme
Despite its celebratory sound, the lyrics deal with grief, mental deterioration, and loss. One interpretation suggests a widow speaking to her deceased husband, experiencing cognitive decline in his absence.

### Call-and-Response Structure
The male and female vocals create a dialogue:
- One voice reassuring
- One voice troubled
- Together creating conversation about mortality and memory

### Craft Techniques
- **Dialogue format**: Two perspectives interacting
- **Dark themes in bright packaging**: Grief sounds like celebration
- **Repeated reassurance**: "Don't listen to a word I say"
- **House as metaphor**: The creaking house represents failing mind

### Lyrical Darkness
Lines about:
- Voices inside heads
- Houses that "don't make a sound"
- Going away and not returning
All dressed in major-key celebration.

## Melodic Analysis

### Dual Vocal Approach
- **Male (Ragnar)**: Lower register, grounding
- **Female (Nanna)**: Higher register, responding
- Together: Harmony and unison for emphasis

### Hook Construction
The "Hey!" hook is brilliantly simple:
- One syllable, easy to shout
- Creates crowd participation moment
- Punctuates between melodic phrases
- Anchors the chorus rhythm

## Harmonic Analysis

### Chord Progression
| E | E | B | C#m |
| A | A | E | E |

### Techniques
- **Major key**: Creates the "happy" sound despite dark lyrics
- **I-V-vi-IV variant**: Anthemic progression
- **Open chords**: Allow acoustic guitar to ring

## Production Notes

### Arrangement Elements
- **Acoustic guitar**: Drives rhythm
- **Electric guitar**: Adds texture and power
- **Trumpet section**: The signature sound
- **Drums**: Big, arena-ready
- **Bass**: Supportive, following roots
- **Multiple vocals**: Layered for thickness

### The Horns
The trumpet/horn section:
- Enters at chorus for maximum impact
- Creates the "indie folk meets mariachi" sound
- Plays counter-melodies, not just backing
- References Beirut, Arcade Fire traditions

### Build Strategy
1. Start acoustic, intimate
2. Add drums
3. Add bass
4. Horns explode at chorus
5. Everything goes huge
6. Fake ending
7. Even bigger return
