## Lyrical Analysis

### Theme
The song captures the obsessive rumination of unrequited desire. The narrator is consumed by wondering if their feelings are reciprocated, unable to escape the mental loop.

### Question Structure
The entire song is built on questions:
- "Do I wanna know?"
- "Are you thinking about me?"
- "Ever thought of calling?"
These questions create vulnerability and tension.

### Craft Techniques
- **Rhetorical questions**: Creates intimacy with listener as confessor
- **Concrete imagery**: "Crawling back to you," "drag my feet"
- **Extended metaphors**: "Magnetic" attraction, "secrets" and "whispers"
- **Self-awareness**: The narrator knows they're obsessing

### Alex Turner's Writing
Turner's lyrics demonstrate:
- Conversational rhythm fitting Sheffield accent
- Clever wordplay without being precious
- Sexual tension through implication, not explicitness
- Vulnerability masked by cool delivery

---

## Melodic Analysis

### Vocal Approach
- Largely monotone verses create hypnotic effect
- Melody rises for emotional emphasis at key moments
- Draws from blues tradition - bent notes, slides
- Delivery is conversational, almost spoken

### Hook Construction
The chorus hook uses:
- Repeated question format
- Descending melody on "do I wanna know"
- Space between phrases for guitar to answer
- Title stretched for emphasis

---

## Harmonic Analysis

### The Riff
The iconic riff is built on:
| Gm | Gm | Gm | Gm |

### Chord Progression
Chorus moves to:
| Eb | Bb | Gm | Gm |

### Techniques
- **Pedal point**: Guitar riff stays on G while bass moves
- **Blues influence**: Minor pentatonic shapes
- **Tension/release**: Chorus provides harmonic movement after static verse

## Production Notes

### The Riff
That guitar riff is the song's defining feature:
- Down-tuned guitar (Drop D)
- Rhythmic, almost tribal pattern
- Delay creates the doubling effect
- Distortion is warm, not aggressive

### Arrangement Elements
- **Drums**: Heavy, deliberate, slow tempo emphasizes weight
- **Bass**: Follows riff for thickness
- **Guitar**: Riff + sparse fills
- **Vocals**: Dry, upfront
- **Handclaps**: Appear in chorus for emphasis

### Production Philosophy
- Leave space - the song breathes
- Slow tempo creates sexual tension
- Heavy without being metal
- Minimalism in parts, maximum in impact

## The Power of Slow

The 85 BPM tempo choice:
- Creates sultry, sexual atmosphere
- Allows space for lyrics to land
- Emphasizes weight of each note
- Contrasts with frantic early Arctic Monkeys

## Key Takeaways

1. **Riffs can be minimal**: One pattern, maximum impact
2. **Questions create connection**: Listener becomes confessor
3. **Slow = sexy**: Tempo communicates mood
4. **Space in arrangement**: What you don't play matters
5. **Blues in indie**: Borrowing traditions refreshes sound

## Writing Exercises

1. Write a song entirely in questions
2. Create a riff using only 3 notes
3. Explore sexual tension without explicit language
4. Try a slow tempo (under 90 BPM) for an otherwise rock song
