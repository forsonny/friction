**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Something you'd say looking at city lights

**Why it works:**
- Universal truth that's not cliche
- "Perfect from far away" implies imperfect up close
- Bittersweet without being sad

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Scientific imagery for romance
**Example:**
> References to bones, iron, and geography

**Why it works:** Grounds abstract love in physical reality

### 2. Conditional optimism
**Example:**
> "I am thinking" not "I know"

**Why it works:** Tentative hope is more believable than certainty

### 3. Scale shifts
**Example:**
> Moves from cellular to cosmic scale

**Why it works:** Love as universal force, not just personal feeling

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I am thinking it's a sign"
   - Sounds said because: "I am thinking" is spoken deliberation

2. > "Everything looks perfect from far away"
   - Sounds said because: Observation anyone might make

3. > "They will see us waving from such great heights"
   - Sounds said because: Childlike imagination

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "We're meant to be" | "I am thinking it's a sign" - uncertain |
| "You complete me" | Uses bone/iron imagery for connection |
| "Love conquers all" | "Perfect from far away" - acknowledges distance |

## Key Takeaways

1. Scientific language can make love songs fresh
2. Uncertainty is more romantic than certainty
3. Electronic production needs human lyrics for warmth
