## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** E (Spiral)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 4 | Quiet desperation |
| Chorus | 4 | The plea |
| Verse 2 | 4 | Building intensity |
| Chorus | 4 | More urgent |
| Bridge | 4 | Breaking point |
| Chorus | 8 | Extended, raw |

**Why this structure works:**
Sparse lyrics with maximum emotional weight. Each chorus escalates because Karen O's delivery intensifies, not the words.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Statement of Condition)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Pack up, I'm straight"

**Why it works:**
Cryptic but urgent. "Straight" could mean sober, direct, or ready. We're dropped into aftermath.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Wait, they don't love you like I love you"

**Syllable count:** 9

**Conversational test:** Pass - Sounds like grabbing someone's arm

**Why it works:**
- "Wait" is a physical interruption
- "They" vs "I" creates competition
- Comparison without naming competition

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Minimal word count
**Example:**
> Entire song has fewer than 100 words

**Why it works:** Every word must carry weight

### 2. Physical verbs
**Example:**
> "Wait" - a body action before it's a word

**Why it works:** Creates visceral urgency

### 3. Repetition as desperation
**Example:**
> "They don't love you" repeated until it fractures

**Why it works:** Shows obsession, fear, breaking

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Wait"
   - Sounds said because: Pure exclamation, physical stop

2. > "They don't love you like I love you"
   - Sounds said because: Jealous outburst, not crafted

3. > "Oh wait"
   - Sounds said because: The "oh" is breath, not word

---

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I love you more" | "They don't love you like" - about them, not amount |
| "Don't leave me" | "Wait" - one word, same meaning |
| "You mean everything" | Never states - shows through desperation |

## Key Takeaways

1. Fewer words can mean more impact
2. Delivery transforms simple lyrics into devastation
3. "Wait" is one of the most powerful words in songwriting
