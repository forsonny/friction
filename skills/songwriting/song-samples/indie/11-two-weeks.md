## Lyrical Analysis

### Theme
The song explores romantic urgency and temporal anxiety - the pressure of limited time creating intensity in desire. The "two weeks" functions as a countdown creating emotional stakes.

### Opening Lines
The song begins with direct address and physical imagery, establishing intimacy immediately. The narrator's longing is framed through bodily sensation.

### Craft Techniques
- **Repetition as hypnosis**: Key phrases repeat with slight melodic variations
- **Ambiguity**: Lyrics resist literal interpretation, creating dreamlike quality
- **Sensory language**: Physical and spatial imagery grounds abstract emotions
- **Compressed syntax**: Truncated phrases create urgency

## Melodic Analysis

### Vocal Melody
- Built on arpeggiated figures that mirror the piano accompaniment
- Range spans about an octave, centering on comfortable falsetto territory
- Phrases often end on unresolved tones, creating forward momentum

### Harmony Stack
The signature sound comes from stacked vocal harmonies:
- Lead melody in mid-range
- Falsetto doubling above
- Bass voice grounding below
- Counter-melodies weaving between

## Harmonic Analysis

### Progression
The song uses a cycling chord progression that never fully resolves:
| F | Am | Dm | Bb |

### Techniques
- **Pedal tones**: Piano maintains rhythmic consistency while harmonies shift
- **Modal mixture**: Occasional borrowed chords add color
- **Voice leading**: Smooth chromatic movement between vocal parts

## Production Notes

### Arrangement Elements
- **Piano**: Rhythmic, almost mechanical repetition creates hypnotic bed
- **Drums**: Tight, controlled kit work with emphasis on hi-hat
- **Bass**: Supportive, following root movement
- **Vocals**: Primary textural element, heavily layered
- **Strings**: Subtle swells in choruses

### Sonic Characteristics
- Dry, close vocal sound despite layering
- Piano slightly compressed for rhythmic punch
