## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Finished with my woman"
   - Sounds said because: Casual phrasing for serious topic

2. > "Can you help me?"
   - Sounds said because: Direct plea

3. > "People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time"
   - Sounds said because: Defensive explanation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'm going crazy" | "Paranoid" - specific diagnosis |
| "Nobody understands" | "Can you help me" - asks directly |
| "Life is pain" | "Occupy my brain" - wants distraction |
