## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Question as guilt transfer
**Example:**
> "Would you still remember me?"

**Why it works:** Makes her the one who might forget, not him who might leave

### 2. Bird as excuse
**Example:**
> "This bird you cannot change"

**Why it works:** Nature argument - can't help being what he is

### 3. Lord as witness
**Example:**
> "Lord knows I can't change"

**Why it works:** Appeals to higher authority for his restlessness

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "If I leave here tomorrow"
   - Sounds said because: Conditional conversation opener

2. > "For I must be traveling on now"
   - Sounds said because: Archaic "for" sounds like explanation

3. > "Please don't take it so badly"
   - Sounds said because: Apologetic plea format

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I love you but I'm leaving" | Questions if she'll remember him |
| "It's not you, it's me" | "This bird you cannot change" - nature, not choice |
| "I'll miss you" | Solo becomes the emotional expression |

## Key Takeaways

1. Metaphor (bird) can excuse difficult behavior
2. Question format can transfer emotional burden
3. Instrumental sections can express what words cannot
