## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Sensory deprivation imagery
**Example:**
> "My hands felt just like two balloons"

**Why it works:** Transforms numbness from abstract to visceral physical sensation

### 2. Childhood as anchor
**Example:**
> "When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse"

**Why it works:** Grounds adult deadness in lost childhood wonder

### 3. Medical as alienation
**Example:**
> "Just a little pinprick, there'll be no more"

**Why it works:** Clinical language emphasizes dehumanization

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Is there anybody home?"
   - Sounds said because: Common phrase for mental absence

2. > "That'll keep you going through the show"
   - Sounds said because: Dismissive, pragmatic management tone

3. > "I can't explain, you would not understand"
   - Sounds said because: Universal expression of being misunderstood

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I feel so empty inside" | "Comfortably numb" - paradox over platitude |
| "Nobody understands me" | "You would not understand" - specific rejection |
| "I'm losing my mind" | "The child is grown, the dream is gone" |
