## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

> "In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream"

> "Baby, we were born to run"

**Syllable count:** 7

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Cars as freedom
**Example:**
> Chrome wheeled, fuel injected details

**Why it works:** Specific car parts = American escape vehicle

### 2. "We" as unit
**Example:**
> Always "we," never just "I"

**Why it works:** Partnership in escape

### 3. Night as possibility
**Example:**
> "At night we ride through the mansions of glory"

**Why it works:** Night is when escape happens

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Together we could break this trap"
   - Sounds said because: Proposal format

2. > "I gotta know how it feels"
   - Sounds said because: "Gotta" is spoken urgency

3. > "Will you walk with me out on the wire"
   - Sounds said because: Question, invitation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Leave this town" generic | Specific: streets, chrome wheels, mansions |
| "Freedom" abstract | Running, driving, physical escape |
| "We'll be happy" | Doesn't promise outcome, just movement |
