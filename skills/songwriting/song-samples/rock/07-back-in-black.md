**Example:**
> "Back in black" - both mourning (for Bon Scott) and rebellion

**Why it works:** Memorial becomes defiant statement of survival

### 2. Automotive/sexual metaphor
**Example:**
> "I got nine lives, cat's eyes"

**Why it works:** Classic rock swagger with feline danger imagery

### 3. Religious imagery subverted
**Example:**
> "Forget the hearse 'cause I never die"

**Why it works:** Death imagery turned into immortality claim

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I've been too long, I'm glad to be back"
   - Sounds said because: Direct address, casual phrasing

2. > "Yes I'm let loose from the noose"
   - Sounds said because: Emphatic "yes" opener

3. > "Nobody's gonna get me on another rap"
   - Sounds said because: Street slang, conversational threat

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'm back and better" | "Back in black" - color as attitude |
| "I'll never give up" | "Forget the hearse 'cause I never die" |
| "Miss me?" | Nine lives imagery - cat always lands |
