## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'"
   - Sounds said because: Dropped g's and casual address

2. > "Way down inside, honey, you need it"
   - Sounds said because: Pet name mid-sentence

3. > "Oh, let me help you"
   - Sounds said because: Simple offer

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I love you so much" | "Whole lotta love" - quantity over declaration |
| "You're beautiful" | Focus on action and need |
| "I'll always be there" | "Gonna give you my love" - active giving |
