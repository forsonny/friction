## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Intro | 8 | Acoustic, mysterious |
| Verse 1-3 | 24 | Building narrative |
| Guitar section | - | Build |
| Final verses | 12 | Climax |
| Guitar solo | - | Peak |
| Outro | 4 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Eight minutes of build. No chorus. The structure IS the journey - acoustic to electric, quiet to loud.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 8 (Object Focus)

**Opening line(s):**
> "There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold"

**Why it works:**
Character introduced through her belief. "Glitters is gold" is proverb inverted.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Stairway to heaven"

**Syllable count:** 5

**Conversational test:** Borderline - It's a metaphor but clear

**Why it works:**
- Aspirational image
- Title only appears once
- Mythic, not personal
- Works as title for the journey

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Mystery maintained
**Example:**
> Never explains the "lady"

**Why it works:** Ambiguity invites interpretation

### 2. Gradual intensity
**Example:**
> Words become more urgent as music intensifies

**Why it works:** Lyrics match the build

### 3. Nature imagery
**Example:**
> "When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed"

**Why it works:** Surreal but grounded in commerce

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Yes there are two paths you can go by"
   - Sounds said because: "Yes" as conversational affirmation

2. > "Ooh, and it makes me wonder"
   - Sounds said because: Thinking out loud

3. > "Your head is humming and it won't go"
   - Sounds said because: Description of sensation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Heaven awaits" religious | Mysterious, not preachy |
| "Journey of life" | Specific lady, specific stairway |
| "We'll reach paradise" | Never promises arrival |

## Key Takeaways

1. No chorus can work for journey songs
2. Mystery is more powerful than explanation
3. Structure can mirror content (build = climb)
