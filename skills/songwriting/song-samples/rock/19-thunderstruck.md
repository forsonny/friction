## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I was caught in the middle of a railroad track"
   - Sounds said because: Story setup format

2. > "I knew there was no turning back"
   - Sounds said because: Common phrase, conversational

3. > "You've been thunderstruck"
   - Sounds said because: Direct address, diagnosis

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You rock my world" | "Thunderstruck" - natural phenomenon |
| "I was amazed" | Physical metaphor: struck by thunder |
| Abstract sensation | Concrete railroad/storm imagery |

## Key Takeaways

1. Single-word hooks can be most powerful
2. Extended intros build anticipation for simple payoff
3. Weather metaphors externalize internal states
