## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Street-level imagery
**Example:**
> "Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor"

**Why it works:** Abstract pressure made viscerally physical

### 2. Question as accusation
**Example:**
> "Why can't we give love one more chance?"

**Why it works:** Rhetorical question indicts all of us

### 3. Love as radical act
**Example:**
> "This is our last dance, this is ourselves under pressure"

**Why it works:** Stakes love as urgent, final, necessary

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "It's the terror of knowing what this world is about"
   - Sounds said because: Confessional, explaining anxiety

2. > "Why can't we give love one more chance?"
   - Sounds said because: Plea format, genuine question

3. > "This is our last dance"
   - Sounds said because: Ultimatum phrasing

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Life is hard" | Physical pressure imagery |
| "Love conquers all" | "Dare to care" - love as courage |
| "We can make it" | "This is our last dance" - urgency |

## Key Takeaways

1. Dual voices can represent internal dialogue
2. Physical verbs (pushing, pressing) beat abstract nouns
3. Positioning love as courage rather than sentiment adds weight
