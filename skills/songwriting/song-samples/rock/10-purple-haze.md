## Opening Technique

**Opening line(s):**
> "Purple haze all in my brain, lately things just don't seem the same"

**Why it works:**
Internal rhyme creates urgency. Vague "things" suggests total reality shift.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Purple haze all in my brain"

**Syllable count:** 7

**Conversational test:** Fail - But captures altered state authentically

**Why it works:**
- Color + sensation = synesthesia
- "All in my brain" localizes the experience
- "Haze" is vague but visceral

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Synesthesia
**Example:**
> "Purple haze" - seeing fog as color

**Why it works:** Blending senses captures altered consciousness

### 2. Temporal confusion
**Example:**
> "Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?"

**Why it works:** Time dissolving matches altered state experience

### 3. Kiss the sky
**Example:**
> "'Scuse me while I kiss the sky"

**Why it works:** Surreal action presented casually - confidence in madness

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Lately things just don't seem the same"
   - Sounds said because: Understatement for major disruption

2. > "'Scuse me while I kiss the sky"
   - Sounds said because: Polite excuse before absurd action

3. > "I don't know if I'm comin' up or down"
   - Sounds said because: Honest confusion admission

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'm so high" | "Purple haze all in my brain" - specific sensation |
| "The world is spinning" | "Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?" - temporal not spatial |
| "I feel strange" | Described the strange feeling specifically |

## Key Takeaways

1. Synesthesia (crossed senses) captures altered states effectively
2. Time confusion adds existential weight to disorientation
3. Casual delivery of surreal content creates confidence
