## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes"
   - Sounds said because: Observation, casual notice

2. > "It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black"
   - Sounds said because: Dropped 'g', confessional tone

3. > "Maybe then I'll fade away"
   - Sounds said because: Wistful conditional

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'm so sad" | Color removal as emotional state |
| "My heart is broken" | "I look inside myself and see my heart is black" |
| "I'll never love again" | Wants everything black - total transformation |

## Key Takeaways

2. Color vocabulary can externalize internal states
3. Obsessive repetition mirrors obsessive grief
