## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Don't ya think that you need somebody?"
   - Sounds said because: Contracted, questioning

2. > "It's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain"
   - Sounds said because: Explaining difficulty

3. > "Everybody needs some time on their own"
   - Sounds said because: Understanding tone, not accusation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'll love you forever" | "Nothing lasts forever" - honest |
| "Don't leave me" | "Everybody needs some time" |
| "You broke my heart" | "Hearts can change" - process, not event |

## Key Takeaways

1. Epic length requires genuine emotional arc, not padding
2. Accepting impermanence can be more powerful than denial
3. Specific season (November) adds weight to weather metaphor
