## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Personal-to-universal zoom
**Example:**
> "Millions of people living as foes"

**Why it works:** Connects individual struggle to global conflict

### 2. Generational indictment
**Example:**
> "Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become"

**Why it works:** Names historical cause without preaching

### 3. Question as accusation
**Example:**
> "Maybe it's not too late to learn how to love"

**Why it works:** Phrased as hope, functions as indictment

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Crazy, but that's how it goes"
   - Sounds said because: Resigned shrug phrasing

2. > "Mental wounds not healing"
   - Sounds said because: Direct clinical observation

3. > "I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools"
   - Sounds said because: Frustrated confession

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "The world is crazy" | "Going off the rails" - we're all passengers |
| "War is bad" | "Heirs of a cold war" - specific anchor |
| "I'm losing my mind" | "Mental wounds" - injury, not madness |
