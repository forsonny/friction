## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Sensory specificity
**Example:**
> "Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place"

**Why it works:** Synesthesia - hair as warmth and safety, not just color or texture

### 2. Vulnerability in hard rock
**Example:**
> "I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain"

**Why it works:** Tough band showing tenderness creates contrast and authenticity

### 3. Breakdown as emotional pivot
**Example:**
> "Where do we go now?"

**Why it works:** Shifts from certainty to anxiety, reveals relationship fear

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "She's got a smile that it seems to me"
   - Sounds said because: "It seems to me" is conversational hedging

2. > "I'd hate to look into those eyes"
   - Sounds said because: "I'd hate to" is casual phrasing

3. > "Where do we go now?"
   - Sounds said because: Actual question people ask in relationships
