## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Character Introduction)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike"

**Why it works:**
Specific character, specific job, specific problem. Working class hero immediately.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Whoa, we're halfway there / Whoa, livin' on a prayer"

**Syllable count:** 6 / 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Encouragement between partners

**Why it works:**
- "Halfway there" is optimistic but honest - not done yet
- "Livin' on a prayer" acknowledges desperation
- "Whoa" is arena-ready, singable

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Named characters
**Example:**
> "Tommy" and "Gina" - not "he" and "she"

**Why it works:** Names create real people, not abstractions

### 2. Economic specificity
**Example:**
> "Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck"

**Why it works:** Real-world problem grounds the anthem

### 3. Musical partnership as metaphor
**Example:**
> "She says we've got to hold on to what we've got"

**Why it works:** Guitar becomes their relationship

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not"
   - Sounds said because: Genuine reassurance between partners

2. > "Take my hand, we'll make it I swear"
   - Sounds said because: Promise format, direct address

3. > "We've got each other and that's a lot"
   - Sounds said because: Simple inventory of resources

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Nameless everyman | Tommy and Gina - specific names |
| "Love conquers all" | "Livin' on a prayer" - survival, not victory |
| Perfect love | Economic struggle acknowledged |

## Key Takeaways

1. Named characters in anthems create emotional investment
2. "Halfway there" is more honest than "almost there"
3. Key change at the end can extend an already epic moment
