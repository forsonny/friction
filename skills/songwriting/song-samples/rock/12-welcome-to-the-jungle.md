## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. City-as-predator metaphor
**Example:**
> "It's got everything you want, honey, we know the names"

**Why it works:** Personifies city as calculating entity

### 2. Second-person seduction
**Example:**
> "You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me"

**Why it works:** Makes listener complicit in potential destruction

### 3. Escalating threat
**Example:**
> "You're in the jungle baby, you're gonna die"

**Why it works:** Drops all pretense - mask comes off at climax

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "We got fun and games"
   - Sounds said because: Street hustler's casual pitch

2. > "You know where you are?"
   - Sounds said because: Confrontational threat

3. > "I wanna watch you bleed"
   - Sounds said because: Blunt, unpoetic menace

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "The city is dangerous" | Made city a speaking character |
| "I'm tough" | "I wanna watch you bleed" - specific, visceral |
| "You'll never survive" | "Learn to live like an animal" |

## Key Takeaways

1. Extended metaphors gain power when sustained
2. Second-person creates immediate stakes
3. Escalation should match content - start seductive, end savage
