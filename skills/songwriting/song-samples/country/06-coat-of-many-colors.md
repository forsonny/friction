## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The making of the coat |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The biblical story |
| Chorus | 4 | Pride statement |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Kids ridicule her |
| Chorus | 4 | Defiance |
| Verse 4 | 8 | Adult reflection |
| Chorus | 4 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Story-driven structure. Each verse is a chapter. The chorus is the thesis that grows in meaning as the story reveals cruelty, then transcendence.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 7 (Place-Grounding)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Back through the years I go wandering"

**Why it works:**
Establishes this is memory, not present. The "wandering" suggests a leisurely revisiting, not a painful dredging up.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "My coat of many colors"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - You'd say "remember that coat of many colors?"

**Why it works:**
- Concrete object carries abstract meaning
- Biblical reference without being preachy
- "Many colors" is visually specific
- It's HER coat, personal ownership

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Poverty shown, not told
**Example:**
> "Made from rags"

**Why it works:** "Rags" is more powerful than "we were poor"

### 2. Story-within-story
**Example:**
> The Joseph tale embedded in the making

**Why it works:** Mother's lesson becomes the frame for understanding

### 3. Child perspective maintained
**Example:**
> "I couldn't understand it"

**Why it works:** Honest about childhood confusion

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "One is only poor only if they choose to be"
   - Sounds said because: It's mama's philosophy, quoted wisdom

2. > "They didn't understand it"
   - Sounds said because: Simple, almost forgiving explanation

3. > "And I just couldn't wait to wear it"
   - Sounds said because: Child's excited anticipation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "We were poor but happy" | Showed the coat, showed the ridicule |
| "Bullies are just jealous" | "They didn't understand" - more generous |
| "Money can't buy happiness" | Never says it, demonstrates it |

## Key Takeaways

1. A single object can carry an entire autobiography
2. Show poverty through specific items, not statements
3. Child perspective plus adult understanding = depth
