## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The diagnosis setup |
| Chorus | 8 | What he did |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Relationships healed |
| Chorus | 8 | More specific actions |
| Bridge | 4 | The lesson |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Application to listener |

**Why this structure works:**
Classic build allows the story to unfold. First chorus is report; final chorus is invitation to listener. The arc moves from "he" to "you."

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 1 (Dialogue Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "He said I was in my early forties"

**Why it works:**
Reported speech. We're hearing the story second-hand, which creates intimacy. "Early forties" is specific age, not vague "middle-aged."

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Live like you were dying"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Advice you'd give a friend

**Why it works:**
- States the philosophy simply
- Paradox: dying to live fully
- Actionable: "live" is a verb
- Works as title and life lesson

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Bucket list as proof
**Example:**
> "Went sky diving, rocky mountain climbing"

**Why it works:** Specific activities show the change, not just state it

### 2. Relationship repair
**Example:**
> "I was finally the husband that most of the time I wasn't"

**Why it works:** Brutal honesty about past failures

### 3. Shift from third to second person
**Example:**
> "He" becomes invitation to "you"

**Why it works:** Personal story becomes universal application

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Most of the time I wasn't"
   - Sounds said because: Self-critical casual admission

2. > "I spent most of the next days"
   - Sounds said because: Vague but real - "most" is honest

3. > "Someday I hope you get the chance"
   - Sounds said because: Direct address, genuine wish

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Life is short" | Showed through specific actions |
| "No regrets" | Admitted regrets, then fixed them |
| "Bucket list" vague | Specific: skydiving, climbing, fishing |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Third-person story can shift to second-person invitation
2. Bucket list items must be specific to be believable
3. Admitting past failure makes redemption credible
