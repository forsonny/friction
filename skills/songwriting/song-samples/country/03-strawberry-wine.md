## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Set the summer scene |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Build to memory |
| Chorus | 8 | The nostalgic thesis |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The relationship deepens |
| Chorus | 8 | Repeated with weight |
| Bridge | 4 | Adult perspective |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Classic structure matches the classic coming-of-age story. The bridge provides the adult hindsight that makes it bittersweet, not just sweet.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 7 (Place-Grounding)

**Opening line(s):**
> "He was working through college on my grandpa's farm"

**Why it works:**
Immediately specific: whose farm, why he's there. We're grounded in a real place with real economics (working through college).

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Strawberry wine"

**Syllable count:** 4

**Conversational test:** Pass - You'd say "remember that strawberry wine?"

**Why it works:**
- Specific sensory detail (not just "wine")
- Evokes taste, summer, sweetness
- The unusual pairing (strawberry + wine) is memorable
- Works as metaphor for innocence/youth without saying so

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Sensory anchoring
**Example:**
> "Hot July moon saw everything"

**Why it works:** The moon as witness, "hot" makes it visceral

### 2. Age as grounding detail
**Example:**
> "Seventeen"

**Why it works:** Specific age is more powerful than "young"

### 3. Time compression
**Example:**
> "Thirty years ago"

**Why it works:** Suddenly we're in adult perspective, the gap is shocking

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I still remember when thirty was old"
   - Sounds said because: The rueful humor of aging

2. > "Like strawberry wine"
   - Sounds said because: It's a simile you'd use describing a memory

3. > "The hot July moon saw everything"
   - Sounds said because: Personifying the moon is folksy, not literary

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "First love" (the phrase) | Never says it, shows it |
| "Summer romance on the farm" | Specific: grandpa's farm, college job |
| "Innocence lost" | "Bittersweet" but earned through detail |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Specific foods/drinks beat generic "memories"
2. One specific age (17, 30) is worth paragraphs of description
3. Sensory details (hot, taste, moon) anchor abstract emotions
