## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** D (Bridge Early)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Set the stormy scene |
| Chorus | 6 | Establish the metaphor |
| Verse 2 | 8 | His guilt, his drive home |
| Chorus | 6 | Thunder = emotional weight |
| Verse 3 | 8 | She confronts the truth |
| Chorus | 6 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
The storm is both literal and metaphorical. Each verse is a scene in a short film. The structure is cinematic - building to confrontation.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Sensory Snapshot)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Three-thirty in the morning, not a soul in sight"

**Why it works:**
Wait - this IS a time opening, but it works because it's paired with sensory emptiness ("not a soul in sight"). The time is plot-functional, not decorative.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "The thunder rolls and the lightning strikes"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's a weather report that means everything

**Why it works:**
- Literal weather description
- Becomes metaphor for emotional storm
- "Rolls" and "strikes" are active verbs
- The rhyme (rolls/strikes) is internal, not end-line

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Weather as character
**Example:**
> Thunder personified throughout

**Why it works:** The storm has agency - it "rolls," it "strikes" - mirrors the drama

### 2. Cinematic scene-setting
**Example:**
> "The smell of her perfume"

**Why it works:** We know he was with another woman without being told

### 3. Parallel structure in characters
**Example:**
> He drives home guilty; she waits knowing

**Why it works:** Both have knowledge they can't escape

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "She's waiting by the window"
   - Sounds said because: Simple present tense, like narrating a scene

2. > "Another love grows cold"
   - Sounds said because: The understatement, the inevitability

3. > "Blame it on the night"
   - Sounds said because: Excuse-making, we recognize the deflection

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Stormy relationship" as tired metaphor | Made the storm literal AND metaphorical |
| "He cheated and felt bad" | Showed the guilt through smell, silence |
| "She was heartbroken" | She already KNOWS - gave her agency |

## Key Takeaways

1. Time-of-day openings CAN work if plot-functional, not decorative
2. Dual literal/metaphorical elements create depth
3. Give all characters agency and knowledge
