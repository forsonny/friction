## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The worry setup |
| Chorus | 6 | The question |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Deepening the fear |
| Chorus | 6 | Question repeated |
| Bridge | 4 | Resolution/answer |
| Final Chorus | 6 | Earned peace |

**Why this structure works:**
Builds anxiety through verses, releases in bridge. The final chorus sounds different because the question has been answered.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Sometimes late at night, I lie awake and watch her sleeping"

**Why it works:**
We're in the bedroom, in the dark, in his head. Intimate immediately. The watching-her-sleep is universal relationship moment.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "If tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I loved her?"

**Syllable count:** 16

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's a 2am worry voiced out loud

**Why it works:**
- Complete thought, not fragment
- "Tomorrow never comes" = death without saying death
- Shifts from abstract fear to concrete concern (will she know?)
- The question format invites listener participation

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Universal anxiety made specific
**Example:**
> "Did I try in every way"

**Why it works:** "Try" is active, "every way" is thorough - shows effort, not just feeling

### 2. Rhetorical questions as chorus
**Example:**
> "Will she know?"

**Why it works:** Keeps listener engaged, not preached at

### 3. Resolution through action
**Example:**
> "Tell that someone that you love"

**Why it works:** The song ends with instruction, not sentiment

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "So I made a promise to myself"
   - Sounds said because: How we actually describe internal decisions

2. > "She's lost within her dreams"
   - Sounds said because: Tender observation of sleeping partner

3. > "The love I gave her wasn't quite enough"
   - Sounds said because: The self-doubt is specific and familiar

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Life is short" | Never says it, shows the fear |
| "Tell her you love her" | Builds to that advice through earned worry |
| "No regrets" | Shows the regret-prevention, not the phrase |

## Key Takeaways

1. Question-as-hook keeps listeners active
2. Universal fears need specific scenarios (watching her sleep)
3. End with action/instruction, not just feeling
