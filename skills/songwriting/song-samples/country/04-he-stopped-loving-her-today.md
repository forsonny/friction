## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Establish his devotion |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Show time passing |
| Chorus | 4 | The punchline |
| Verse 3 | 8 | The reveal setup |
| Chorus | 4 | Now we understand |
| Spoken | 4 | Final twist |
| Outro | 4 | Emotional landing |

**Why this structure works:**
The delayed chorus is essential - the whole song is a setup for a punchline. If the chorus came early, the gut-punch would be ruined.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "He said I'll love you till I die"

**Why it works:**
We enter mid-story. Someone is quoting someone else. We're immediately in a narrative, not a description.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "He stopped loving her today"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's news you'd deliver with a sigh

**Why it works:**
- Sounds like a headline or announcement
- The "today" makes it urgent/recent
- We don't know WHY until the reveal
- Works as title before you know the twist

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Dramatic irony through withholding
**Example:**
> The entire song withholds that he died

**Why it works:** Listener figures it out; more powerful than being told

### 2. Physical details for emotional weight
**Example:**
> "Kept some letters by his bed"

**Why it works:** Letters by the bed = tangible devotion

### 3. Time markers create arc
**Example:**
> "Dated 1962"

**Why it works:** Specific date shows decades of waiting

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "He said I'll love you till I die"
   - Sounds said because: Direct quote, reported speech

2. > "She came to see him one last time"
   - Sounds said because: Like you're telling a friend the story

3. > "We all wondered if she would"
   - Sounds said because: "We all" - collective observation, gossip

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Died of a broken heart" | Never says it, shows the devotion and lets death speak |
| "He loved her forever" | Shows the years (1962 dates, faded photos) |
| "She never knew how much" | She DID come to see him, complicating it |

## Key Takeaways

1. Withhold the key information until it destroys
2. Physical objects (letters, photos) beat emotional descriptions
3. Third-person narrator can be more devastating than first-person
