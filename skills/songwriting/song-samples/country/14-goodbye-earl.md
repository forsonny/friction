Introduces characters immediately. "Best of friends" sets up the partnership that will commit murder. Simple declarative.

**The hook:**
> "Goodbye Earl"

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Escalation through details
**Example:**
> "Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta"

**Why it works:** Specific city, "flew" = urgency, friendship proven

### 2. Dark comedy through casualness
**Example:**
> "They had a plan"

**Why it works:** Murder reduced to "plan" - understated

### 3. Legal system failure
**Example:**
> "Restraining order didn't help"

**Why it works:** Justifies vigilante justice through institutional failure

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Well, it wasn't two weeks"
   - Sounds said because: "Well" opener, casual time marker

2. > "Turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all"
   - Sounds said because: Sardonic observation, wordplay

3. > "Ain't it dark, wrapped up in that tarp"
   - Sounds said because: Rhyme scheme sounds like kids' rhyme

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "She was stuck with an abuser" | Showed the abuse AND the solution |
| Tragic victim narrative | Dark comedy, empowerment |
| "Justice will prevail" | DIY justice |

## Key Takeaways

1. Dark comedy requires tonal control
2. "Goodbye [Name]" can be a hook if the context is strong
3. Casual language for serious subjects creates irony
