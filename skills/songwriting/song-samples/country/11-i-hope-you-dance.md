| Verse 2 | 8 | More guidance |

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 4 (Rhetorical Question implied)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I hope you never lose your sense of wonder"

**Why it works:**
Starts with hope, not description. We're immediately in maternal wish territory. "Sense of wonder" is specific enough to not be cliche.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I hope you dance"

**Syllable count:** 4

**Conversational test:** Pass - A mother would say this

**Why it works:**
- "Dance" as metaphor for fully living
- Short, memorable, singable
- Works literally (dancing) and figuratively (engaging with life)
- The "I hope" makes it gentle, not demanding

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Wish as structure
**Example:**
> Every line is an "I hope" wish

**Why it works:** Creates consistency without monotony

### 2. Specific blessings
**Example:**
> "When you get the chance to sit it out or dance"

**Why it works:** Binary choice is clear and actionable

### 3. Faith without preaching
**Example:**
> "God is great"

**Why it works:** Mentioned briefly, not sermon

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter"
   - Sounds said because: "Hell-bent" is spoken vernacular

2. > "Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance"
   - Sounds said because: "Passing glance" is casual language

3. > "Livin' might mean takin' chances"
   - Sounds said because: Apostrophes indicate spoken rhythm

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Follow your dreams" | "Take chances" - active, not dreamy |
| "Life is precious" | Shows through specific hopes |
| "Remember what matters" | Lists what matters specifically |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. "I hope" is gentler than advice or command
2. Binary choices (sit/dance) clarify abstractions
3. Metaphors that work literally AND figuratively are strongest
