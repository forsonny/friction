## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** G (Minimal)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The bad days |
| Chorus | 4 | The transformation |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The comparison |
| Chorus | 4 | Repeat |
| Outro | 4 | Riff on the hook |

**Why this structure works:**
Minimal structure lets the voice carry everything. This is a performance song - less structure means more room for soul.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Confession/Admission)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Used to spend my nights out in a barroom"

**Why it works:**
Past tense establishes change has happened. "Used to" = transformation narrative. "Barroom" is specific setting.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's a compliment you'd actually give

**Why it works:**
- Compares lover to a drink (bold)
- "Tennessee" adds specificity and pride
- "Smooth" as positive quality
- The comparison works: both intoxicating

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Addiction to love comparison
**Example:**
> Whiskey/drugs/love conflated

**Why it works:** Love as the cure for other addictions

### 2. Regional pride
**Example:**
> "Tennessee"

**Why it works:** Grounds the metaphor geographically

### 3. Simple repeated structure
**Example:**
> "You're as..." repeated

**Why it works:** Creates incantation feel

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Used to spend my nights out in a barroom"
   - Sounds said because: Past tense confession tone

2. > "You're the sweetest thing I ever knew"
   - Sounds said because: Simple, direct compliment

3. > "Looking for a warm place to hide"
   - Sounds said because: Vulnerable admission without poetry

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You saved me" | Shows the salvation through metaphor |
| "Love is a drug" | Makes the drug comparison specific (whiskey) |
| "I was lost" | "Liquor and love" as what he was searching in |

## Key Takeaways

1. Regional specificity (Tennessee) grounds metaphors
2. Comparing lover to intoxicant can work if committed
3. Minimal structure lets voice and performance dominate
