## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Establish escape fantasy |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Deepen backstory |
| Chorus | 4 | The hope/dream |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Reality sets in |
| Chorus | 4 | Same words, darker meaning |
| Verse 4 | 8 | Full disappointment |
| Chorus | 4 | Now sounds desperate |

**Why this structure works:**
Delayed chorus builds anticipation. By the time we hear "fast car," we understand all the weight behind that dream. The repetition gains meaning each time.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 1 (Dialogue Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "You got a fast car"

**Why it works:**
Drops us mid-conversation. We're already in an intimate moment. No setup needed - we immediately understand the dynamic between two people.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Fast car"

**Syllable count:** 2

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's literally something you'd say pointing at a car

**Why it works:**
- Extremely short, memorable
- Concrete object, not abstract concept
- Becomes metaphor without trying to be one
- Title you can hum

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Specificity over abstraction
**Example:**
> "Managed to save just a little bit of money"

**Why it works:** Not "struggling financially" - shows the math of poverty

### 2. Dialogue creates character
**Example:**
> "Maybe we can make a deal"

**Why it works:** We hear her voice, her negotiating tone, her hope

### 3. Time jumps without announcement
**Example:**
> "So I remember when we were driving"

**Why it works:** Moves between past and present fluidly, like memory actually works

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I had a feeling I could be someone"
   - Sounds said because: The hedging "had a feeling" instead of "I knew"

2. > "You still ain't got a job"
   - Sounds said because: Direct confrontation, "ain't" is spoken not written

3. > "Is it fast enough so we can fly away?"
   - Sounds said because: The question format, the dreamy "fly away" kids actually say

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Escaping to somewhere better" | Showed escape failing |
| "Love conquers poverty" | Showed love eroded by poverty |
| "Following your dreams" | Showed dreams deferred and compromised |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. A two-word hook can carry an entire narrative
2. Let the same chorus mean different things through context
3. Specificity about money ("convenience store") > vague struggle
