## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The rescue |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The commitment |
| Chorus | 4 | The vulnerability |
| Verse 3 | 8 | The fear and hope |
| Chorus | 4 | Repeat |
| Outro | 4 | Promise |

**Why this structure works:**
Story needs time. Each verse reveals more about the recovery. Minimal chorus makes it more impactful when it arrives.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun"

**Why it works:**
Metaphor as action. We're mid-defense-mode. The internal rhyme (run/gun) catches attention.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Cover me up and know you're enough"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - Intimate request to partner

**Why it works:**
- "Cover" = protect, shelter, hide
- "Know you're enough" = addresses partner's insecurity
- Mutual vulnerability
- Short, intimate, specific

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Recovery without saying "recovery"
**Example:**
> The addiction arc is shown, never stated

**Why it works:** Trusts listener to understand

### 2. Relationship as salvation
**Example:**
> "I sobered up, I swore off that stuff forever"

**Why it works:** Direct but in context of relationship

### 3. Fear and hope mixed
**Example:**
> "Born of a sign"

**Why it works:** Believes in fate but stays grounded

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "But my queen of the rodeo"
   - Sounds said because: Specific nickname, personal

2. > "I swore off that stuff forever"
   - Sounds said because: Casual description of sobriety

3. > "So girl, leave your boots by the bed"
   - Sounds said because: Specific domestic instruction

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You saved me from myself" | Shows the rescue through specific actions |
| "I was hitting rock bottom" | Shows the guns, the drinking, the running |
| "Love healed me" | "Cover me up" - protective, not healing language |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Recovery songs can show the journey without naming it
2. Nicknames ("queen of the rodeo") add intimacy
3. "Cover me up" is protection, not repair - different relationship
