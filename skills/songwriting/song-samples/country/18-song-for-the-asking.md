## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** G (Minimal)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The feeling |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The effect |
| Bridge | 4 | Affirmation |
| Verse 3 | 8 | The continuation |

**Why this structure works:**
Almost no chorus - the verses carry everything. This matches the song's intimacy. It's a meditation, not a declaration.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 8 (Object Focus... or rather, Movement Focus)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Something in the way she moves"

**Why it works:**
Specific and vague simultaneously. "Something" acknowledges mystery. "The way she moves" is physical but not explicit.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Something in the way she moves"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's exactly what someone would say

**Why it works:**
- "Something" = ineffability of attraction
- "The way she moves" = physical without being crude
- Works as title
- Mysteriously specific

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Mysterious admiration
**Example:**
> "Attracts me like no other lover"

**Why it works:** Comparison without putting down others

### 2. Effect over cause
**Example:**
> What she DOES to him, not who she is

**Why it works:** Shows the relationship's impact

### 3. Simple vocabulary
**Example:**
> No five-dollar words anywhere

**Why it works:** Matches the sincere simplicity

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I feel fine anytime she's around me now"
   - Sounds said because: Casual "I feel fine," present tense

2. > "She comes to me when I'm feeling down"
   - Sounds said because: Simple domestic comfort described simply

3. > "Every day in every way it's getting better and better"
   - Sounds said because: Almost a self-help phrase, grounded in experience

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Her beauty is..." | Describes effect, not appearance |
| "I love you more than..." | No comparisons, just presence |
| "You complete me" | Shows her effect, not dependency language |

## Key Takeaways

1. "Something" can be a hook when mystery is the point
2. Minimal structure works for intimate songs
3. Effect on the narrator > description of the beloved
