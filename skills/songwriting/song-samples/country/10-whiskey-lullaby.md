## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | His decline |
| Chorus | 6 | The lullaby metaphor |
| Verse 2 | 8 | His death |
| Chorus | 6 | Repeated |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Her guilt |
| Chorus | 6 | Parallel structure |
| Verse 4 | 8 | Her death |
| Final Chorus | 6 | Tragic symmetry |

**Why this structure works:**
The story requires length - two tragedies, parallel. The repetition of the chorus between each death creates haunting symmetry.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Confession/Admission)

**Opening line(s):**
> "She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette"

**Why it works:**
Simile is unexpected and visceral. "Burning end" = the pain, "midnight" = the darkness, "cigarette" = something easily discarded.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Put him to sleep with a whiskey lullaby"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Dark euphemism people use

**Why it works:**
- "Lullaby" is nurturing; "whiskey" is destroying
- The contradiction creates the tragedy
- Euphemism for drinking yourself to death
- Ironic tenderness

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Parallel structure for dual tragedy
**Example:**
> His story, then her story, same structure

**Why it works:** Symmetry emphasizes that both are destroyed

### 2. Euphemism as devastation
**Example:**
> "Lullaby" for dying

**Why it works:** Gentle word for brutal act increases impact

### 3. Communal witness
**Example:**
> "We watched him drink his pain away"

**Why it works:** Third-person plural - community saw and did nothing

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "We watched him drink his pain away"
   - Sounds said because: Gossip tone, "we" as helpless witnesses

2. > "He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger"
   - Sounds said because: Brutal directness, news-report clarity

3. > "Nothing worked"
   - Sounds said because: Two-word summary of failed interventions

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "He drank himself to death" | "Whiskey lullaby" - poetic but not precious |
| "She died of a broken heart" | She followed the same path - concrete action |
| "They're together now" | Doesn't offer that comfort |

## Key Takeaways

1. Euphemism can be more brutal than directness
2. Parallel structures create tragic inevitability
3. Community as witness adds moral weight
