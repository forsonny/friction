| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Child at ten |
| Chorus | 6 | The carousel |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Teenage years |
| Chorus | 6 | Time passing |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Twenty years |
| Chorus | 6 | Still turning |
| Verse 4 | 8 | Adult looking back |

**Why this structure works:**
Circular structure for circular theme. Each verse ages the subject; chorus remains constant like time itself.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Observation)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Yesterday a child came out to wonder"

**Why it works:**
"Yesterday" - already in the past. "Wonder" - childhood state that will be lost.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "We're captive on the carousel of time"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Wistful observation

**Why it works:**
- "Captive" - no escape
- "Carousel" - childhood image for adult trap
- Endless circle, no destination

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Age progression
**Example:**
> Ten, sixteen, twenty - specific markers

**Why it works:** Shows time passing without stating "time passes"

### 2. Painted imagery
**Example:**
> "Painted ponies" - carousel as life metaphor

**Why it works:** Beautiful but trapped

### 3. Seasonal cycles
**Example:**
> Autumn, leaves, seasons recurring

**Why it works:** Nature mirrors human cycles

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Time flies" | "Carousel of time" - visual, moving |
| "Youth is wasted on the young" | Shows joy, not waste |
| "Getting old is hard" | "Circle game" - playful frame |
