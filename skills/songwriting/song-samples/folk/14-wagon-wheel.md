## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Verse-Chorus)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Hitchhiking journey |
| Chorus | 8 | The plea to rock |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Specific geography |
| Chorus | 8 | Building energy |

Road song structure - verses are miles traveled, chorus is the destination. Simple framework for complex journey.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Mid-Action)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Heading down south to the land of the pines"

**Why it works:**
Already moving. Not "I'm going to" but "Heading down" - we're on the road.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel"

**Syllable count:** 9

**Conversational test:** Pass - Desperate but playful plea

**Why it works:**
- "Rock me" - comfort and rhythm
- "Mama" - not literal mother, term of endearment
- Wagon wheel - constant motion, old-timey image

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Geographic specificity
**Example:**
> "Johnson City, Tennessee" - exact location

**Why it works:** Real places make the journey real

### 2. Sensory details
**Example:**
> "I thumbed my way from the cold North"

**Why it works:** We feel the weather and the gesture

### 3. Unfinished Dylan
**Example:**
> Built from Dylan's discarded sketch

**Why it works:** Historical DNA gives authenticity

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Heading down south to the land of the pines"
   - Sounds said because: How you'd answer "where you going?"

2. > "I got no one to call my own"
   - Sounds said because: Lonely admission

3. > "I ain't turning back to living that old life no more"
   - Sounds said because: Determination through double negative

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Long road ahead" | Specific routes and towns |
| "Going home" | "Rock me mama" - destination is a person, not place |
| "I'm a rambler" | Shows rambling, doesn't state it |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Specific geography beats vague "down the road"
2. A destination can be a person, not a place
3. Hitchhiking songs need sensory details
