Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "But now they only block the sun"
   - Sounds said because: Disappointed realization

2. > "I've looked at love from both sides now"
   - Sounds said because: Tired wisdom

3. > "Something's lost but something's gained"
   - Sounds said because: Philosophical shrug

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I've learned so much" | "I really don't know" |
| "Love is beautiful" | "Recall" vs. reality |
| "Life has meaning" | "Something's lost, something's gained" |
