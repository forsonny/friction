**Why it works:** Ancient stories mirror modern experience

### 2. Musical as spiritual
**Example:**
> "The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall"

**Why it works:** Music theory as theology

### 3. Broken as beautiful
**Example:**
> "It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah"

**Why it works:** Imperfect praise is still praise

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "But you don't really care for music, do you?"
   - Sounds said because: Bitter aside to lover

2. > "Well, maybe there's a God above"
   - Sounds said because: Tentative theology

3. > "All I ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you"
   - Sounds said because: Cynical confession
