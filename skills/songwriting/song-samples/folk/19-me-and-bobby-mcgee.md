**Genre:** Folk Rock

## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Hitchhiking scene |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Singing together |
| Chorus | 4 | Freedom thesis |
| Verse 3 | 8 | California |
| Verse 4 | 8 | The leaving |
| Chorus | 4 | Now bitter |
| Outro | 4 | Memory call |

**Why this structure works:**
Road trip structure collapses when Bobby leaves. Same chorus means different things before and after departure.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 7 (Anecdote)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train"

**Why it works:**
Immediate situation - broke, stranded, specific place. We're in the story.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose"

**Syllable count:** 12

**Conversational test:** Pass - Bar philosophy

**Why it works:**
- Paradox that feels true
- "Just another word" - dismissive yet profound
- Becomes bitter after loss

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Geographic journey
**Example:**
> Baton Rouge to California - America mapped

**Why it works:** Physical journey = emotional journey

### 2. Ambiguous Bobby
**Example:**
> Gender unclear in original - universal

**Why it works:** Anyone can project their Bobby

### 3. Same words, different meaning
**Example:**
> "Freedom" before loss vs. after

**Why it works:** Chorus recontextualizes

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Busted flat in Baton Rouge"
   - Sounds said because: How you'd describe being broke

2. > "Feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues"
   - Sounds said because: Memory with "Lord" interjection

3. > "I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday"
   - Sounds said because: Desperate bargaining

---

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "We were young and free" | Specific scenes, not summary |
| "Love is freedom" | Freedom is loss |
| "I miss you" | "I'd trade all my tomorrows" |

## Key Takeaways

1. A line can reverse meaning through context
2. Geographic specificity creates credibility
3. Gender ambiguity can create universality
