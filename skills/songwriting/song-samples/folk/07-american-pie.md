## Opening Technique

Fairy tale opening for American mythology. "Can still remember" - the past haunts the present.

**The hook:**
> "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"

**Syllable count:** 7

**Conversational test:** Pass - Sounds like a toast or farewell

**Why it works:**
- Nonsensical yet meaningful
- "Bye-bye" is childlike
- "Miss American Pie" - title that demands explanation

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Coded history
**Example:**
> Real events disguised as imagery

**Why it works:** Creates puzzle, rewards repeated listening

### 2. Recurring imagery
**Example:**
> Chevy, levee, whiskey - return throughout

**Why it works:** Builds mythology through repetition

### 3. Question structure
**Example:**
> "Do you believe in rock and roll?"

**Why it works:** Makes listener participate

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "A long, long time ago"
   - Sounds said because: Storyteller opening

2. > "Do you believe in rock and roll?"
   - Sounds said because: Direct question

3. > "This'll be the day that I die"
   - Sounds said because: Declaration, not prediction

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "The 60s were crazy" | Specific coded images |
| "Music isn't what it used to be" | "The music died" - definitive |
| "Remember when" nostalgia | Complex, ambivalent journey |

## Key Takeaways

1. Long songs need consistent imagery to hold together
