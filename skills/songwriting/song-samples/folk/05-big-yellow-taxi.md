## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** List of losses

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 4 | Paradise paved |
| Chorus | 4 | "Don't it always seem to go" |
| Verse 2 | 4 | Trees in museum |
| Chorus | 4 | Reinforcement |
| Verse 3 | 4 | DDT and bees |
| Chorus | 4 | Building urgency |
| Verse 4 | 4 | Man leaves |
| Chorus | 4 | Personal and universal |

**Why this structure works:**
Environmental examples build to personal loss - same principle applies.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 1 (Action Taken)

**Opening line(s):**
> "They paved paradise and put up a parking lot"

**Why it works:**
Concrete action. "Paradise" to "parking lot" - maximum contrast, same number of syllables.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gone"

**Syllable count:** 18

**Conversational test:** Pass - Common wisdom phrased conversationally

**Why it works:**
- Universal truth everyone recognizes
- "Don't it" is conversational, not "Doesn't it"
- Applies to environment and relationships

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Scale shift
**Example:**
> Paradise to parking lot, farmer to DDT, then "my old man"

**Why it works:** Same principle applies at every scale

### 2. Museum absurdity
**Example:**
> "Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum"

**Why it works:** Preserving nature by removing it - the irony

### 3. Dollar fifty for admission
**Example:**
> Specific cost adds satire

**Why it works:** Commodification of nature made literal

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Don't it always seem to go"
   - Sounds said because: "Don't it" is conversational grammar

2. > "Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now"
   - Sounds said because: Direct plea, repetition for emphasis

3. > "Late last night I heard the screen door slam"
   - Sounds said because: Specific detail of departure

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Save the Earth" | Specific: parking lot, tree museum, DDT |
| "Appreciate what you have" | "You don't know what you've got till it's gone" |
| "Nature is beautiful" | Shows what's lost, not what exists |

## Key Takeaways

1. Specific examples beat abstract principles
2. Same truth can apply at different scales
3. Conversational grammar creates intimacy
