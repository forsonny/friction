> "Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed"

Peaceful scene before the disruption. Sunlight into darkness - the relationship's arc in one line.

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Shifting pronouns
**Example:**
> "I," "he," "she" perspectives shift without warning

**Why it works:** Memory is unreliable; identity is fluid

### 2. Time collapse
**Example:**
> Past and present tense mix within verses

**Why it works:** How memory actually works

### 3. Literary reference
**Example:**
> "Poems from 13th century Italian" - specific, unexpected

**Why it works:** Elevates the personal to universal

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind"
   - Sounds said because: "I seen" is spoken grammar

2. > "She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced"
   - Sounds said because: Gossipy setup

3. > "We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view"
   - Sounds said because: Relationship wisdom

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "The one that got away" | She's neither gone nor captured |
| Linear love story | Time shuffled, perspectives mixed |
| "I'll never forget" | Shows forgetting and remembering |

## Key Takeaways

1. Pronouns can be deliberately unstable
2. Memory doesn't follow chronology
3. A recurring line can mean different things each time
