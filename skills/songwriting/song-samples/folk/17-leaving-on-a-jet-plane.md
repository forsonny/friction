| Verse 2 | 8 | Regrets, promises |

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Observation)

**Opening line(s):**
> "All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go"

**Why it works:**
Physical readiness contrasts with emotional unreadiness. The bags are packed; the heart isn't.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again"

**Syllable count:** 14

**Conversational test:** Pass - Literal statement of situation

**Why it works:**
- No metaphor - just the truth
- "Don't know when" - uncertainty is the pain
- Modern transport, timeless emotion

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Physical detail as emotional state
**Example:**
> "Bags are packed" - organized exterior, chaotic interior

**Why it works:** Shows through objects, not statements

### 2. Time specificity
**Example:**
> "Early morn" - the worst time for goodbyes

**Why it works:** Pre-dawn departures feel more final

### 3. Future promises
**Example:**
> "When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring"

**Why it works:** Commitment despite departure

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I hate to wake you up to say goodbye"
   - Sounds said because: Apologetic, quiet

2. > "So kiss me and smile for me"
   - Sounds said because: Request in the moment

3. > "I'm leaving on a jet plane"
   - Sounds said because: Statement of fact

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Parting is such sweet sorrow" | Physical details - taxi waiting |
| "I'll miss you" | Shows by not wanting to leave |
| "Wait for me" | "Hold me like you'll never let me go" |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Literal statements can be more powerful than metaphors
2. Physical details externalize internal states
3. Repetition in goodbyes is realistic and emotional
