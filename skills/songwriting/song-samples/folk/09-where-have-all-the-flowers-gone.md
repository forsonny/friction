| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 4 | Flowers gone |
| Verse 2 | 4 | Girls gone |
| Verse 3 | 4 | Young men gone |
| Verse 4 | 4 | Soldiers gone |
| Verse 5 | 4 | Graveyards gone |
| Verse 6 | 4 | Returns to flowers |

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 4 (Rhetorical Question)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Where have all the flowers gone, long time passing?"

**Why it works:**
Childlike question hides adult grief. "Long time passing" - this has been happening forever.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "When will they ever learn?"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Exhausted question

**Why it works:**
- "They" - deliberately vague
- "Ever" - implies it may never happen
- Question, not statement - invites reflection

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Chain of causation
**Example:**
> Flowers -> Girls -> Men -> Soldiers -> Graves -> Flowers

**Why it works:** Shows war as inevitable cycle

### 2. Simplicity as power
**Example:**
> Same melody, same question structure each verse

**Why it works:** Child could sing it; adult understands it

### 3. Absent accusation
**Example:**
> Never names an enemy or cause

**Why it works:** Universal application across all wars

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Where have all the flowers gone?"
   - Sounds said because: A child might ask this

2. > "Long time passing"
   - Sounds said because: Weary addendum

3. > "When will they ever learn?"
   - Sounds said because: Parental exasperation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "War is hell" | Shows cycle without stating |
| "Blame the leaders" | "They" - undefined |
| "Peace will come" | "When will they" - doubt, not hope |

## Key Takeaways

1. Circular structure can show cyclical themes
2. Questions are more powerful than accusations
3. Children's song simplicity can carry adult grief
