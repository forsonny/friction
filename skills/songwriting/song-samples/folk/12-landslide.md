## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 4 (Rhetorical Question)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I took my love and I took it down"

**Why it works:**
Ambiguous action. "Took it down" - dismantled? descended? Both meanings work.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Landslide will bring it down"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Fatalistic acceptance

**Why it works:**
- Landslide is natural, unstoppable
- "It" - deliberately vague (youth? love? self?)
- Not if, but when

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Mirror as device
**Example:**
> "Climbed a mountain and I turned around"

**Why it works:** Looking back to see how far you've come/fallen

### 2. Seasonal change
**Example:**
> "Seasons" - natural aging metaphor

**Why it works:** Inevitable without being depressing

### 3. Child addressing parent
**Example:**
> The song addresses her father through the child metaphor

**Why it works:** Generational anxiety made personal

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?"
   - Sounds said because: Genuine self-doubt

2. > "Can I handle the seasons of my life?"
   - Sounds said because: Vulnerable question

3. > "Well, I've been afraid of changing"
   - Sounds said because: Confession opener

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Time flies" | Physical metaphors - landslide, mirror |
| "I'm getting old" | "Seasons of my life" |
| "Stay young at heart" | Accepts the landslide will come |
