**Example:**
> Suicide mentioned between passing the biscuits

**Why it works:** Family's casualness is the horror

### 2. Mysterious object
**Example:**

**Example:**
> Narrator knew more than she told the table

**Why it works:** Guilt revealed slowly

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Pass the biscuits, please"
   - Sounds said because: Dinner table mundanity

2. > "Billie Joe never had a lick of sense"
   - Sounds said because: Dismissive Southern idiom

3. > "Seems like nothing ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge"
   - Sounds said because: Local superstition

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "It was a tragedy" | Family eats through the news |
| Explained motive | Leaves the mystery unsolved |
| "I'll never forget" | Shows forgetting (brother married, moved) |
