## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The lie, the poor boy |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Searching, loneliness |
| Chorus | 4 | Lie-la-lie refrain |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Seeking comfort |
| Chorus | 4 | Wordless release |
| Verse 4 | 8 | The boxer revealed |
| Outro | 8 | Extended lie-la-lie |

**Why this structure works:**
Story builds to reveal - the boxer is metaphor for anyone who endures. "Lie-la-lie" releases what words can't express.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 6 (Thematic Declaration)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told"

**Why it works:**
Humble declaration. "Seldom told" - the overlooked, the invisible. We're about to hear what's usually silenced.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Lie-la-lie"

**Syllable count:** 3

**Conversational test:** Pass - Wordless singing anyone does

**Why it works:**
- Not words, but not silence
- Can mean anything
- Collective singing moment

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Universal "I"
**Example:**
> "I am just a poor boy" - anyone can be this

**Why it works:** Invites identification

### 2. Physical specificity
**Example:**
> "Seventh Avenue" - grounded in real place

**Why it works:** Authenticity through detail

### 3. The boxer as metaphor
**Example:**
> "Still a man hears what he wants to hear"

**Why it works:** Fighter = survivor = everyone

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I am just a poor boy"
   - Sounds said because: Self-deprecating introduction

2. > "Asking only workman's wages"
   - Sounds said because: Humble request

3. > "In the clearing stands a boxer"
   - Sounds said because: Pointing to reveal

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Life is hard" | Specific images of hardship |
| "I'll keep fighting" | "I am leaving, I am leaving" - ambiguity |
| "Victory" ending | "Fighter still remains" - just survival |

## Key Takeaways

1. Non-verbal hooks can be the most powerful
2. Survival is its own victory
3. Physical metaphors ground abstract struggles
