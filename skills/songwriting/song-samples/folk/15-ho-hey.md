## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 6 (Thematic Declaration)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I've been trying to do it right"

**Why it works:**
Universal struggle - trying to live correctly but failing. Immediate sympathy.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart"

**Syllable count:** 14

**Conversational test:** Pass - Declaration you'd make

**Why it works:**
- Mutual belonging, not possession
- "Sweetheart" - old-fashioned, sincere
- Parallel structure creates rhythm

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Non-lexical vocables
**Example:**
> "Ho Hey" - meaningless but memorable

**Why it works:** Creates communal singing moment

### 2. Contrast to find clarity
**Example:**
> "I don't think you're right for him" - what she shouldn't be

**Why it works:** Defines love through rejection of alternative

### 3. Simplicity as strength
**Example:**
> No metaphors, no imagery - just direct statement

**Why it works:** Sometimes clarity beats poetry

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I've been trying to do it right"
   - Sounds said because: Excuse/explanation

2. > "I belong with you, you belong with me"
   - Sounds said because: Declaration

3. > "So show me family"
   - Sounds said because: Demand

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "We're meant to be" | "Belong" - active choice |
| "I love you" | "You're my sweetheart" - specific |
| "Let me prove my love" | "Show me family" - future-focused |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Nonsense syllables can be the most memorable part
2. Direct statements can beat metaphor
3. "Belong" implies choice; "meant to be" implies fate
