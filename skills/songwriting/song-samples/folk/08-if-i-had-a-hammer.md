## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 4 (Rhetorical Setup)

**Opening line(s):**
> "If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning"

**Why it works:**
Conditional but certain. "If I had" but immediately "I'd" - no doubt about the action, only the tool.

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "If I had a hammer"
   - Sounds said because: Wishful thinking, conversational

2. > "All over this land"
   - Sounds said because: Sweep of arm gesture

3. > "It's the hammer of justice"
   - Sounds said because: Revelation, explanation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Fight for freedom" | Physical tools for abstract goals |
| "We shall overcome" | Individual action repeated collectively |
| "Rise up" | "Hammer" - work, not just uprising |

## Key Takeaways

1. Abstract ideals need physical metaphors
2. Repetitive structure creates participation
3. Simple songs can carry complex messages
