## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** C (Slow Burn)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Suzanne's death |
| Chorus | 4 | The endurance |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Breakdown, recovery |
| Chorus | 4 | Same words, new weight |
| Verse 3 | 8 | Career uncertainty |
| Chorus | 4 | Becomes mantra |

**Why this structure works:**
Each verse is a different trauma; chorus becomes the thread of survival connecting them.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 7 (Anecdote)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone"

**Why it works:**
"They let me know" - received news, not witnessed. Distance makes grief more painful, not less.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I've seen fire and I've seen rain"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - Weathered survivor speaking

**Why it works:**
- Elemental opposition - fire/rain
- "I've seen" - experience, not philosophy
- Vague enough to mean anything, specific enough to feel true

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Named subject
**Example:**
> "Suzanne" - real person, not "you" or "she"

**Why it works:** Specificity demands we take the loss seriously

### 2. Institutional language
**Example:**
> "They let me know" - clinical, distanced

**Why it works:** Shows how grief is mediated, not direct

### 3. Time anchoring
**Example:**
> "Just yesterday morning" - painfully recent

**Why it works:** Immediacy creates intimacy

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Just yesterday morning"
   - Sounds said because: How you'd start telling someone

2. > "I've seen fire and I've seen rain"
   - Sounds said because: Tired summary of hard life

3. > "Won't you look down upon me, Jesus"
   - Sounds said because: Desperate prayer, not formal

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "She was taken too soon" | "They let me know you were gone" - procedural |
| "I'll never forget you" | Names her, then moves to next trauma |
| "God's plan" | "Won't you look down upon me" - questioning |

## Key Takeaways

1. Naming real people makes loss undeniable
2. Clinical language can intensify emotion
3. A hook can be vague if the verses are specific
