## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** D (Bridge Early... actually dual perspectives)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | His complaint |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Building resentment |
| Chorus | 8 | The reduction |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Her rebuttal |
| Chorus | 8 | Shared phrase, different meaning |
| Outro | 4 | Fading repetition |

**Why this structure works:**
Duet structure serves the content. Each person has their truth. Same chorus means different things to each.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Now and then I think of when we were together"

**Why it works:**
Immediate past-tense reflection. "Now and then" = still thinking about it. We're post-breakup.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Somebody that I used to know"

**Syllable count:** 8

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's how people describe exes

**Why it works:**
- Reduction of person to "somebody"
- Past tense relationship ("used to")
- Cold and final
- Could be bitter or accepting

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Second perspective rebuttal
**Example:**
> Kimbra's verse contradicts his victimhood

**Why it works:** No one is completely right

### 2. Gaslight implication
**Example:**
> "Have your friends collect your records"

**Why it works:** Specific post-breakup detail

### 3. Same hook, different meanings
**Example:**
> He says it bitterly, she says it defensively

**Why it works:** The repetition gains dimensions

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "But you didn't have to cut me off"
   - Sounds said because: Direct accusation

2. > "Make out like it never happened"
   - Sounds said because: "Make out like" is casual

3. > "No you didn't have to stoop so low"
   - Sounds said because: The "no" is argumentative

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You broke my heart" | "You didn't have to cut me off" - action |
| One-sided victim narrative | Gave her a rebuttal |
| "I'll always love you" | Reduction to "somebody" |

## Key Takeaways

1. Duets can debate, not just harmonize
2. Same phrase from two perspectives creates depth
3. Reducing someone to "somebody" is devastating
