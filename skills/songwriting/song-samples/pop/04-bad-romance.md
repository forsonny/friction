## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** B (Chorus First)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Hook | 4 | "Ra ra ra" intro |
| Verse 1 | 8 | Want the ugly |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | "You and me" |
| Chorus | 8 | "I want your love" |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Psycho-drama |
| Chorus | 8 | Repeat |
| Bridge | 8 | "Walk of shame" |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Full release |

**Why this structure works:**
Immediate hook establishes the theatrical world. Then the dark content enters that established space.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** Unique - Nonsense sounds

**Opening line(s):**
> "Ra ra ah ah ah, roma roma ma"

**Why it works:**
Completely hooks before meaning enters. The sounds are phonetically satisfying and memorable.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I want your bad romance"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Borderline - It's a strange request, which is the point

**Why it works:**
- Wants the BAD specifically
- Subverts "I want your love"
- "Romance" is formal, "bad" is casual - tension
- Clear statement of unconventional desire

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Nonsense as hook
**Example:**
> "Ra ra ah ah ah"

**Why it works:** Pure sound before meaning

### 2. Inventory of wants
**Example:**
> "I want your ugly, I want your disease"

**Why it works:** Lists the dark desires specifically

### 3. French phrase
**Example:**
> "Je veux ton amour"

**Why it works:** Theater, sophistication, camp

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "You know that I want you"
   - Sounds said because: Direct assertion

2. > "I want your love and I want your revenge"
   - Sounds said because: Parallel structure is conversational

3. > "I don't wanna be friends"
   - Sounds said because: The rejection phrase everyone knows

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I want your love" alone | Added the ugly, the disease, the revenge |
| "Love me tender" | "Bad romance" embraces dysfunction |
| Love song format | Made it about obsession |

## Key Takeaways

1. Nonsense syllables can be the entire opening hook
2. "Bad" + positive noun creates instant tension
3. Listing what you want can structure a verse
