## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye"

**Why it works:**
Past tense memory. "Couldn't look you in the eye" = immediate vulnerability and shame.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Self-assessment someone might blurt

**Why it works:**
- Self-identification with negative labels
- "Creep" and "weirdo" are casual words
- Honest self-hatred
- The admission is the catharsis

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Worship that distances
**Example:**
> "You're so very special"

**Why it works:** Puts her on pedestal, him below

### 2. Self-sabotage admission
**Example:**
> "I don't belong here"

**Why it works:** Pre-rejection

### 3. Contrast between her and him
**Example:**
> "You're so f***ing special, I wish I was special"

**Why it works:** The gap stated clearly

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "What the hell am I doing here"
   - Sounds said because: "What the hell" is spoken phrase

2. > "I don't care if it hurts"
   - Sounds said because: Bravado/desperation mix

3. > "I want you to notice when I'm not around"
   - Sounds said because: Needy statement someone would make

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You're too good for me" | "I'm a creep" - owns the fault |
| "I can't help loving you" | Shows the uncomfortable obsession |
| "Someday you'll see my worth" | No redemption promised |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Self-identification with negative labels is honest
2. "Special" repeated gains ironic weight
3. No redemption arc makes it more real
