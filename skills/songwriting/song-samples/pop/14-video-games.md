## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Mundane as romantic
**Example:**
> Watching him play video games

**Why it works:** Finds beauty in ordinary moments

### 2. Americana imagery
**Example:**
> "Heaven is on earth"

**Why it works:** Creates a nostalgic dreamscape

### 3. Small moments magnified
**Example:**
> "I heard that you like the bad girls"

**Why it works:** Gossip/rumor as intimate detail

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "I heard that you like the bad girls"
   - Sounds said because: "I heard" = gossip report

2. > "Honey is for bees, silly bear"
   - Sounds said because: Playful, casual endearment

3. > "It's you, it's you, it's all for you"
   - Sounds said because: Emphatic declaration

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'll do anything for you" | Shows devotion through small acts |
| "Our perfect romance" | Shows mundane moments elevated |
| "You're my everything" | "Video games" - specific, unexpected |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Mundane moments can be more romantic than grand gestures
2. "Video games" as unexpected hook creates signature
3. Stacked images (swinging, fast car) create scene quickly
