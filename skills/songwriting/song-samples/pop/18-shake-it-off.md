## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Haters gonna hate hate hate"
   - Sounds said because: Internet-era phrase, casual

2. > "It's gonna be alright"
   - Sounds said because: Reassurance phrase

3. > "At least that's what people say"
   - Sounds said because: Attribution, distancing

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Don't let them get you down" | "Shake it off" - physical, active |
| "I don't care what they think" | Shows not caring through action |
| "They're just jealous" | Doesn't accuse, just dismisses |

## Key Takeaways

1. Physical action ("shake") beats emotional instruction
2. Quoting critics shows you hear them but don't care
3. Repetition ("hate hate hate") reduces criticism to noise
