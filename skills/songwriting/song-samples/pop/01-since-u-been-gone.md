## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** B (Chorus First... almost)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | Fake optimism |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | The buildup |
| Chorus | 8 | Release |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The truth emerges |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Build again |
| Chorus | 8 | Explosion |
| Bridge | 4 | Declaration |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Victory |

**Why this structure works:**
The chorus is pure catharsis. Pre-chorus builds impossible tension. Structure is standard but execution is perfect.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Confession/Admission)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Here's the thing, we started out friends"

**Why it works:**
"Here's the thing" is how people actually begin stories. Immediately conversational. We're about to get the real version.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Since you been gone"

**Syllable count:** 5

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's literally a phrase people say

**Why it works:**
- Grammatically incorrect ("you've" would be proper) = casual, angry
- Works for liberation AND revenge
- Short, screamed, memorable
- The "U" spelling is text-message casual

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. The pivot
**Example:**
> From "we started as friends" to "I can breathe for the first time"

**Why it works:** The thesis changes - this isn't about missing him

### 2. Physical relief
**Example:**
> "Breathe for the first time"

**Why it works:** Tangible sensation, not abstract emotion

### 3. Self-awareness of anger
**Example:**
> The screaming, the intensity - she knows what she's doing

**Why it works:** Controlled chaos

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Here's the thing"
   - Sounds said because: How people preface explanations

2. > "Thanks to you, now I get what I want"
   - Sounds said because: Sarcastic gratitude

3. > "But that's something I'd never do"
   - Sounds said because: Self-righteous aside

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'll miss you" | "I can breathe" - relief, not grief |
| "You broke my heart" | Shows freedom, not damage |
| "We were so good together" | "Started as friends" - debunks the myth |

## Key Takeaways

1. Breakup songs can be about liberation, not loss
2. "Here's the thing" beats "Let me tell you"
3. Physical sensations (breathe) beat emotional abstractions
