## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The scene |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Watching them |
| Chorus | 8 | The lonely dance |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Closer observation |
| Chorus | 8 | Repeat |
| Bridge | 4 | "So far away" |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Dance song structure for a song about dancing alone. The irony is built into the form.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 7 (Place-Grounding)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Somebody said you got a new friend"

**Why it works:**
Gossip report. "Somebody said" = she heard through others. Already pain.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I'm in the corner watching you kiss her"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Report of experience

**Why it works:**
- Specific location (corner)
- Specific action (kiss her)
- Voyeuristic pain
- Not "I'm heartbroken" - shows the scene

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Dance floor as emotional battlefield
**Example:**
> The club becomes the site of loss

**Why it works:** Location matches the musical genre

### 2. Action over feeling
**Example:**
> "Watching you kiss her" not "seeing you moved on"

**Why it works:** Image creates feeling

### 3. Dancing as coping
**Example:**
> "I keep dancing on my own"

**Why it works:** The lonely version of what couples do

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Somebody said you got a new friend"
   - Sounds said because: Gossip delivery

2. > "I'm just gonna dance all night"
   - Sounds said because: The decision, "just gonna"

3. > "I'm giving it my all"
   - Sounds said because: Effort stated simply

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Crying over you" | Dancing - action, not passivity |
| "You left me" | Shows him with someone new |
| "I'll find someone else" | Stays in the lonely moment |

## Key Takeaways

1. Specific location (corner) beats vague "watching"
2. Dance songs can carry deep sadness
3. Action (dancing) as coping mechanism
