## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** G (Minimal)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The distance |
| Chorus | 6 | The admission |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The power |
| Chorus | 6 | Repeat |
| Bridge | 4 | "Who do you think you are" |
| Final Chorus | 6 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Minimal structure for a song about mental state. Less is more. Each section is potent.

---

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Confession/Admission)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I remember when, I remember when I lost my mind"

**Why it works:**
Casual admission of insanity. "I remember when" is nostalgic framing for something dark.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Does that make me crazy?"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Question someone would literally ask

**Why it works:**
- Question format invites participation
- "Crazy" is reclaimed, not ashamed
- Challenges the definition
- The "does that" is conversational

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Insanity as freedom
**Example:**
> "There was something so pleasant about that place"

**Why it works:** Not treating crazy as purely negative

### 2. Philosophical questioning
**Example:**
> "Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are"

**Why it works:** Turns the judgment back on the listener

### 3. Remembering as frame
**Example:**
> "I remember when I lost my mind"

**Why it works:** Distance from the experience allows examination

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Does that make me crazy? Probably"
   - Sounds said because: The self-answering, "probably" is casual

2. > "Ever since I was little"
   - Sounds said because: Childhood origin story phrasing

3. > "My heroes had the heart to lose their lives"
   - Sounds said because: Personal philosophy stated directly

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "I'm going crazy for you" (love) | Actual mental state examination |
| "You're driving me crazy" (blame) | Self-examination, no external cause |
| "Crazy in love" | Just crazy, period |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Question as hook creates interaction
2. "Crazy" can be reclaimed, not just confessed
3. Casual language ("probably") grounds big concepts
