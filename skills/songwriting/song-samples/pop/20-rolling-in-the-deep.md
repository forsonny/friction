## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 2 (Sensory Snapshot)

**Opening line(s):**
> "There's a fire starting in my heart"

**Why it works:**
Physical sensation of emotion. "Fire" is cliche but the "starting" makes it active.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "We could have had it all"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Exact phrase of regret people use

**Why it works:**
- Past conditional = lost possibility
- "All" is what was lost
- "We" makes him complicit
- Universal phrase of regret

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Fire imagery throughout
**Example:**
> Fire, burn, scars

**Why it works:** Consistent imagery builds heat

### 2. "We" includes him in the failure
**Example:**
> "We could have had it all"

**Why it works:** Not just blaming - shared loss

### 3. Regret without begging
**Example:**
> Doesn't ask him back

**Why it works:** Anger, not desperation

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "See how I'll leave with every piece of you"
   - Sounds said because: Threat structure

2. > "Don't underestimate the things that I will do"
   - Sounds said because: Direct warning

3. > "We could have had it all"
   - Sounds said because: Common phrase of regret

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You broke my heart" | Fire/burn imagery - more active |
| "I loved you" | "We could have had it all" - about potential |
| "Please come back" | Anger, not pleading |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Fire imagery works if committed to throughout
2. "We could have had" is more devastating than "I wanted"
3. Breakup songs can be angry, not just sad
