## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Uptown funk you up"

**Syllable count:** 5

**Conversational test:** Borderline - It's a made-up phrase but catchy

**Why it works:**
- "Uptown" = aspirational, classy
- "Funk" = genre and attitude
- Sounds like profanity without being it
- Playful, danceable

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Inventory of cool
**Example:**
> Lists items: ice cold, white gold, stylin', Julio

**Why it works:** Creates world through accumulation

### 2. Call and response
**Example:**
> "Don't believe me just watch"

**Why it works:** Invites participation

### 3. Self-reference
**Example:**
> "This hit" in the song itself

**Why it works:** Confident meta-commentary

3. > "Girls hit your hallelujah"
   - Sounds said because: DJ call-out energy

| "Party all night" | Focused on attitude, not activity |
| "Best night ever" | Never claims, just demonstrates |
