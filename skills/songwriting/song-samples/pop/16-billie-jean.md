## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The warning |
| Chorus | 6 | The denial |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The claim |
| Chorus | 6 | Repeat |
| Verse 3 | 8 | The encounter |
| Final Chorus | 6 | Resolution |

**Why this structure works:**
Story-driven structure. Each verse advances the narrative. Chorus is the defense.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 1 (Dialogue Fragment)

**Opening line(s):**
> "She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene"

**Why it works:**
Immediate characterization. "Movie scene" = unreal, performance. We're in the drama.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Billie Jean is not my lover"

**Syllable count:** 7

**Conversational test:** Pass - Denial someone would literally say

**Why it works:**
- Name creates specificity
- "Not my lover" is direct denial
- The protest-too-much energy
- Works as title and defense

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Third person for gossip distance
**Example:**
> "She" throughout

**Why it works:** Like telling someone else's story

### 2. Paranoia through detail
**Example:**
> "Be careful what you do, don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"

**Why it works:** Mother's warning sets up the moral stakes

### 3. Denial as structure
**Example:**
> The whole song is defense

**Why it works:** Protest creates drama

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "She says I am the one"
   - Sounds said because: Reported claim, accusatory

2. > "But the kid is not my son"
   - Sounds said because: Emphatic denial

3. > "Be careful what you do"
   - Sounds said because: Warning advice, conversational

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "She broke my heart" | He's the accused, not the victim |
| "Love story" frame | Legal/paternity drama |
| "I loved her but..." | Denies ever being involved |

## Key Takeaways

1. Proper name as hook creates instant character
2. Denial/defense can structure an entire song
3. Third person creates gossip/story distance
