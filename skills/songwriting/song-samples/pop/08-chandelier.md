## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** A (Classic Build)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The party facade |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | "Holding on" |
| Chorus | 8 | The swing |
| Verse 2 | 8 | The hangover truth |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Build |
| Chorus | 8 | Repeat |
| Bridge | 4 | "1, 2, 3" |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Full release |

**Why this structure works:**
Classic build for maximum vocal catharsis. The pre-chorus is the tension, chorus is the release.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "Party girls don't get hurt"

**Why it works:**
Immediately ironic. The statement is clearly false. We're in the lie.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier"

**Syllable count:** 9

**Conversational test:** Borderline - It's imagery, but clear intention

**Why it works:**
- Physical act as metaphor for abandon
- "Swing" implies recklessness AND joy
- Chandelier is specific, elegant, fragile
- The "gonna" is committed

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Ironic declaration
**Example:**
> "Party girls don't get hurt"

**Why it works:** Immediately undercut by the song's pain

### 2. Counting as structure
**Example:**
> "1, 2, 3, drink"

**Why it works:** Ritualistic drinking pattern

### 3. Morning vs. night contrast
**Example:**
> "Sun is up, I'm a mess"

**Why it works:** The reckoning after the party

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Can't feel anything"
   - Sounds said because: Numbing described simply

2. > "Gotta get out now, gotta run from this"
   - Sounds said because: The urgency, the "gotta"

3. > "I'm just holding on for tonight"
   - Sounds said because: Survival mentality

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Party all night" fun | Showed the desperation behind it |
| "I'm living my best life" | "Holding on" - barely surviving |
| "Dancing queen" | Swinging from chandelier - precarious |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Ironic opening statements create tension
2. Physical actions (swing) carry emotional weight
3. "1, 2, 3" counting creates ritualistic feel
