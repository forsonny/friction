## Structure Analysis

**Structure Type:** D (Bridge Early... inverted)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Verse 1 | 8 | The rejection of excess |
| Pre-Chorus | 4 | Defiance |
| Chorus | 8 | The fantasy/reality |
| Verse 2 | 8 | Suburban truth |
| Chorus | 8 | Repeat |
| Bridge | 4 | We're OK |
| Final Chorus | 8 | Victory lap |

**Why this structure works:**
The structure serves the thesis: pop songs promise excess, this one rejects it. Minimal but impactful.

## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 5 (Confession/Admission)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I've never seen a diamond in the flesh"

**Why it works:**
Immediate class positioning. "In the flesh" is an interesting phrase for an object. Sets up the anti-luxury thesis.

---

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "We'll never be royals"

**Syllable count:** 6

**Conversational test:** Pass - Resignation stated factually

**Why it works:**
- Rejection of aspiration
- "We" makes it communal
- "Never" is definitive
- "Royals" is specific to pop excess critique

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Pop critique through pop
**Example:**
> Name-drops Cristal, Maybach, etc. while rejecting them

**Why it works:** Knows the tropes, dismantles them

### 2. Teen perspective
**Example:**
> "We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams"

**Why it works:** Fantasy acknowledged, reality accepted

### 3. Made-up word
**Example:**
> "Let me be your ruler"

**Why it works:** Fantasy engagement while critiquing it

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "But everybody's like"
   - Sounds said because: Teen speak, casual comparison

2. > "That kind of lux just ain't for us"
   - Sounds said because: "Ain't" and casual dismissal

3. > "We don't care"
   - Sounds said because: Blunt, unbothered

---

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Money can't buy happiness" | Didn't moralize, just stated preference |
| "We're different and proud" | "We'll never be royals" - factual, not proud |
| "Real love is enough" | Doesn't promise love solves anything |

## Key Takeaways

1. Rejecting genre tropes within genre is powerful
2. "We" generalizes the narrator's experience
3. Specificity in what you reject (brand names) strengthens criticism
