## Opening Technique

**Opening line(s):**
> "You and me, we used to be together"

**Why it works:**
Immediate past tense. "Used to be" signals the change. Simple statement of loss.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Don't speak, I know just what you're saying"

**Syllable count:** 10

**Conversational test:** Pass - Exactly what someone would say to avoid hearing bad news

**Why it works:**
- Command format
- "I know" = she already gets it
- Avoidance as coping mechanism
- Denial in action

---

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Denial as action
**Example:**
> Asking not to be told what she knows

**Why it works:** Shows the bargaining stage of grief

### 2. Time contrast
**Example:**
> "We used to be" vs. now

**Why it works:** Past happiness sharpens present pain

### 3. Stopping the moment
**Example:**
> "Don't speak" freezes time before the final words

**Why it works:** Impossible wish is relatable

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Don't tell me 'cause it hurts"
   - Sounds said because: Direct plea, casual "'cause"

2. > "I know just what you're saying"
   - Sounds said because: Cutting someone off mid-sentence

3. > "You and me, we used to be together"
   - Sounds said because: Starting with "You and me"

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You broke my heart when you said..." | Refuses to let him say it |
| "I couldn't believe it" | "I know just what you're saying" |
| "How could you do this" | Doesn't accuse, just asks for silence |

## Key Takeaways

1. Command as hook can be powerful
2. Denial/avoidance is a valid emotional state to capture
3. "I know" can preempt what doesn't need saying
