## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack"
   - Sounds said because: Casual debauchery, "bottle of Jack"

2. > "Boys tryin' to touch my junk"
   - Sounds said because: Blunt, colloquial

3. > "Tonight, I'mma fight till we see the sunlight"
   - Sounds said because: "I'mma" is spoken contraction

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Party all night" generic | Specific: P. Diddy, Jack Daniels, speakers |
| "Dancing queen" | "Feeling like P. Diddy" - specific aspiration |
| "Best night of my life" | Shows the night, doesn't declare it |
