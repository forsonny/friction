## Opening Technique

**Technique:** 3 (Action in Progress)

**Opening line(s):**
> "I threw a wish in the well, don't ask me I'll never tell"

**Why it works:**
Mystery immediately. She's not telling us everything. The rhyme is playful.

## Hook Analysis

**The hook:**
> "Call me maybe"

**Syllable count:** 4

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's literally something someone would say

**Why it works:**
- The "maybe" is the genius
- Not demanding ("call me")
- Vulnerable and uncertain
- Short enough to repeat endlessly
- The casualness hides the longing

## Notable Lyrical Techniques

### 1. Undermining confidence
**Example:**
> "And all the other boys try to chase me"

**Why it works:** She has options but picked him anyway

### 2. Escalation
**Example:**
> "Ripped jeans, skin was showing"

**Why it works:** Simple physical description, not flowery

### 3. The maybe
**Example:**
> Not "call me" - "call me MAYBE"

**Why it works:** All the vulnerability in one word

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "This is crazy"
   - Sounds said because: Self-aware about the intensity

2. > "Don't ask me, I'll never tell"
   - Sounds said because: Playful secrecy

3. > "Here's my number, so call me maybe"
   - Sounds said because: It's literally the transaction

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "You're so hot" | "Ripped jeans, skin was showing" - specific |
| "I fell hard for you" | Shows the obsession through behavior |
| "Please call me" desperation | "Maybe" is casual about it |

## Key Takeaways

1. One word ("maybe") can carry all the emotion
2. Playful mystery beats earnest declaration
3. Simple physical details ("ripped jeans") beat generalizations
