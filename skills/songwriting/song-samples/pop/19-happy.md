> "It might seem crazy what I'm about to say"

> "Because I'm happy"

**Syllable count:** 5

**Conversational test:** Pass - It's literally the answer to "why are you smiling?"

**Why it works:**
- Simple statement
- "Because" implies it's an explanation
- One emotion, one word
- The directness is disarming

> "It might seem crazy"

## "Said Not Written" Lines

Lines that sound like real speech:

1. > "Can't nothing bring me down"
   - Sounds said because: Double negative is spoken

2. > "Here come bad news talking this and that"
   - Sounds said because: "This and that" is casual dismissal

3. > "Clap along if you know what happiness is to you"
   - Sounds said because: Conditional invitation

## Cliche Avoidance

**Cliches this song could have used but didn't:**

| Expected Cliche | What They Did Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Life is beautiful" | "Room without a roof" - specific |
| "Don't worry be happy" | Acknowledges potential criticism first |
| "Everything's gonna be alright" | Focuses on current state, not future |

## Key Takeaways

1. Pre-defending positivity ("it might seem crazy") adds credibility
2. "Because" implies this answers a question
3. "Clap along if" makes audience part of the song
